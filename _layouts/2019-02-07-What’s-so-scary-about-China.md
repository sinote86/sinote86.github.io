## China-US

[Trump Will Not Meet President Xi Jinping of China Before Trade Deal Deadline](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/trump-xi-jinping-china-trade.html) <br> *by Alan Rappeport, from nytimes.com, 20190207*

> The decision not to meet ahead of the deadline was a reversal for Mr. Trump, who said last week that he planned to meet with Mr. Xi to resolve any “final issues” before a trade deal. Mr. Trump, who made the comments during two days of negotiations between American and Chinese trade officials, suggested a face-to-face meeting could be combined with his trip to Asia in late February for a summit meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.
>
> On Thursday, Mr. Trump ruled out such a meeting before the March deadline. Asked by reporters if the meeting with Mr. Xi would take place in the next month or so, Mr. Trump said: “Maybe. Probably too soon.” As to whether the two leaders would meet before the deadline, Mr. Trump said, “no” and nodded his head.

> The tech giant has had a meteoric rise over the last ten years. It has overtaken Apple in the global smartphone market, and its equipment is in telecommunications systems in 170 countries worldwide. But Huawei now finds itself at the centre of a global scandal.

[We Can’t Tell if Chinese Firms Work for the Party](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/07/we-cant-tell-if-chinese-firms-work-for-the-party/) <br> *by Ashley Feng, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190207*

> Western governments should not automatically conclude that Chinese companies are acting as agents of the party because such firms are ultimately still in charge of their own business decisions. But the lines have been dangerously blurred. Chinese domestic laws and administrative guidelines, as well as unspoken regulations and internal party committees, make it quite difficult to distinguish between what is private and what is state-owned.

> Yet in the last four years in particular, the Chinese government has been actively working to increase its influence over private companies through regulatory measures. The National Intelligence Law of 2017 was an important milestone. It instructs every organization or citizen to support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence work, building upon the legal framework set forth by both the national security and cybersecurity laws.

> IP is one of the main fronts in President Donald Trump’s trade war against China. It is also the crux of an indictment in America against Huawei, a Chinese tech giant. In both cases, the government seeks to give the impression that stealing from the West is part of the modus operandi of Chinese firms, something a *Wall Street Journal* columnist described last week as a practice they regard as a “[patriotic duty](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-can-destroy-huawei-11548806847)”.

> But that is lazy thinking. The Chinese state may encourage philandering of ideas, and foreign firms in China doubtless face pressure to surrender their secrets. Yet IPprotection in China, for all its flaws, has improved at rocket speed of late. As Chinese firms issue more patents, the keener they are to protect them. Some executives even tacitly support American pressure, hoping it will strengthen the rule of law. In an echo of the fawning nickname “Xi Dada”, some have whispered “Trump Dada”, or Daddy Trump.

## Taiwan

[China lures Taiwanese into ‘brainstorming’ talks on island’s future](https://www.ft.com/content/4eb88028-263f-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632) <br> *by Kathrin Hille, from ft.com, 20190207*

> China has started pulling mainland-based Taiwanese businesspeople and students into “brainstorming” sessions on the future of the de facto independent nation, as President Xi Jinping seeks to show progress in moving towards unification.
>
> During the past month, officials from China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, which sets and implements Taiwan policy, have invited members of the Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises on the Mainland to “study sessions” and “discussion forums” on Mr Xi’s latest Taiwan policy lines, according to six members in Shanghai and the provinces of Fujian and Jiangsu.

[Does China understand Taiwan?](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/02/09/does-china-understand-taiwan) <br> *from economist.com, 201920207*

> Put bluntly, China’s proposals sound creepy to many young, urban Taiwanese. In effect, they hear a demand to submit to marriage with a stern cousin, arranged decades ago: “I am rich now, let me cherish you—or I will kill you.”
>
> Taiwanese defiance may anger China’s leaders. But they cannot safely ignore it. Any Chinese victory would need to be quick, with Taiwan’s will to fight broken so swiftly that calls for an American rescue become moot. Taiwanese security experts are frank about what they fear: a psychological collapse among the public, for instance after initial waves of Chinese missiles wreck more than half the island’s defences, or blow up oil and gas terminals to cut power supplies. Then there is the question of what happens the day after China wins. Politicians predict mass protests in Taiwanese cities. Would China send tanks to subdue its sullen new satrapy?

[How Facebook’s Tiny China Sales Floor Helps Generate Big Ad Money](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/technology/facebook-china-internet.html) <br> *by Paul Mozur & Lin Qiqing, from nytimes.com, 20190207*

> The desire by Chinese companies and other entities to get in front of people internationally has unexpectedly turned China into one of Facebook’s largest sources of advertising revenue, even though the social network itself is not available in the country. Charles Shen, chief executive of Meet Social, said his company anticipated doing $1 billion to $2 billion in ad sales on Facebook and Instagram this year. Each day, he added, Meet Social’s software puts up about 20,000 Chinese ads on Facebook.
>
> In total, Facebook’s revenue from Chinese-based advertisers reached an estimated $5 billion in 2018, or about 10 percent of its total sales, according to Pivotal Research Group. That would be enough to rank Facebook somewhere around the seventh-largest listed internet company in China.
