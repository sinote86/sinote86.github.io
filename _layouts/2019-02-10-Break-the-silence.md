[Turkey Urges China to End Mass Detention of Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/world/asia/china-turkey-uighurs.html) <br> *by Amy Qin, from nytimes.com, 20190210*

> Turkey has called China’s mass repression of its Uighur Muslim ethnic minority a “great shame for humanity” and has urged the Chinese government to close detention camps estimated to hold a million people, a rare rebuke from a majority-Muslim country.
>
> ...
>
> The statement from Turkey, which is home to a large community of Chinese Uighurs, came as a surprise to members of the Uighur diaspora, many of whom have been pressuring the governments of predominantly Muslim countries to speak out about China’s crackdown on Muslim communities.

> Despite [growing evidence of forced labor, indoctrination and other abuses](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/world/asia/un-xinjiang-uighurs-china.html?module=inline) in Xinjiang, countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan have remained relatively silent on the issue — a sign, some say, of China’s increasing political and economic clout. While the governments of Malaysia and Indonesia have [voiced concerns about the Uighurs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-12/anwar-is-appalled-by-suu-kyi-criticizes-china-s-muslim-camps), Turkey’s statement is by far the strongest yet from a majority-Muslim country.

[Revealed: 17 Australian residents believed detained in China's Uighur crackdown](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/11/revealed-17-australian-residents-believed-detained-in-chinas-uighur-crackdown) <br> *by Kate Lyons, from theguardian.com, 20190210*

> The 17 cases – 15 Australian permanent residents and two on spouse visas – have been collected by Nurgul Sawut, an advocate for Uighurs in Australia, through interviews with their family members.
>
> The individuals are believed to have been detained while on trips to China visiting relatives. Many have children or spouses who are Australian citizens.
>
> It is difficult to confirm their fates, given the secretive nature of the camps, but Sawut believes one of the group is in prison, four are under house arrest, and the remaining 12 are in detention centres.

[Beijing’s Olympics Paved the Way for Xinjiang’s Camps](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/08/beijings-olympics-paved-the-way-for-xinjiangs-camps/) <br> *by Nithin Coca, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190208*

> As the Year of the Pig begins, in Beijing and the mountainous Yanqing district just 50 miles from the capital, construction is well underway for the 2022 Winter Olympics, now just three years away. Meanwhile, at the other end of the country, another form of construction is going on. Beijing’s internment camps for Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are believed to hold around a million inmates. As China’s oppression of minorities and civil society grows, so should questions about whether the Olympics should be hosted by Beijing at all—especially as Beijing’s 2008 Summer Olympics marked a turning point in renewed oppression.

> The Olympics was a chance for the world to put pressure on China for its abysmal human rights record, or at least the situation in Tibet. Instead, outside of some minor, token actions, such as a few heads of state missing the opening ceremony, the world turned a blind eye to the obvious hard-handed state response to Tibet’s unrest, and China got its massive propaganda moment.

[Where Is China’s Foreign Policy Headed?](http://www.chinafile.com/conversation/where-chinas-foreign-policy-headed) <br> *by A ChinaFile Conversation, from chinafile.com, 20190208*

> With China’s global influence and tensions between Washington and Beijing growing apace, what is the best way to understand how China envisions itself in the world? Some contend China’s leaders seek global preeminence; others, that they are principally focused on restoring China’s dominant position within the Asia-Pacific; and yet others, that the country’s engagement abroad is still primarily rooted in fulfilling domestic imperatives. Which conclusion is correct? Which documents, statements, and actions should observers pay attention to in rendering their judgments? —*The Editors*

> **Zha Daojiong**: A more serious source of difficulty in dialogues is fundamental disagreement between Chinese and mainstream Western thinking on international politics, particularly concerning the mentally accepted geographical scope of China. For mainstream scholars in China, debates over which party, the United States (and its allies) or China, is working to destroy a rules-based regional/international order must begin with finding common ground on this question.
>
> **Jessica Chen Weiss**: In short, domestic politics matter in ways that have been insufficiently appreciated and documented. Historical parallels or analogies—whether to the Cold War or the “Thucydides Trap”—provide relatively little analytic traction. It has never been more critical to understand how domestic political dynamics are shaping China’s varied and evolving international behavior.
>
> **Michael Swaine**: China’s modern history of division and humiliation at the hands of the West and Japan, along with its deep-rooted cultural pride and long history of centrality within the Asian geopolitical landscape, lead Beijing to place a high premium on restoring China’s greatness and respect through the attainment of high levels of national wealth and power and a heavy emphasis on the sovereignty principle in international affairs. Chinese leaders have confirmed these foreign and domestic goals and views since at least the May Fourth Movement.
>
> **Carla Freeman**:  ... that China is both dissatisfied with established international arrangements and is prepared to change them to better serve China’s interests. China has already begun that process, now headquartering two new development banks on its shores, innovating new regional groupings, and challenging prevailing interpretations of international laws. Global power and influence—both material and cultural—are thus goals China clearly pursues, but so far at least, preeminence is not the measure of achievement.
>
> **Chen Dingding**: The outside world can shape how China interacts with the international order. If it mistakenly views China as an expansionist power and seeks to contain its rise, China will be forced to respond—sometimes violently. In the meantime, China should become more transparent and follow global rules of trade and governance. At the end of the day, it can only prosper in a peaceful and orderly world.
>
> **Peter Mattis**: International wealth and power on C.C.P. terms—the so-called “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”—cannot be disentangled from Beijing’s domestic security imperatives. This is not an either/or question. All political parties in power must balance the tensions between pursuing desired policies and remaining in power; the means are what differ across political systems. Part of the C.C.P.’s foreign policy objectives is the acceptability of the Party’s legitimacy, norms, and activities internationally. If the C.C.P. is not around to see China’s wealth and power, then the Party will have failed in half of its objectives.
