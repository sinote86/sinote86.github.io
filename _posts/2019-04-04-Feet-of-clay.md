## Slowdown

> Is the Chinese economy recovering from its slowdown at the end of last year? “Yes”, say [Gavyn Davies](https://www.ft.com/content/c085c2e4-4235-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3), Goldman Sachs and many others. During my recent visit to Shanghai and Beijing, a number of economists and private businessmen also indicated growing optimism about China’s economic prospects. Why do they think this and are they likely to be right?

> The private sector has been the engine of China’s growth. If the authorities are determined to support it, this matters. Quite surprisingly to me, some Chinese people I met were even pleased that the US was pressuring China to liberalise the economy: the better the government had to treat foreign private business, the better it would also have to treat domestic private business. I wonder whether US negotiators understand the implications of letting private entrepreneurs off the state’s leash.

> The flurry of government debt issuance and a boom in infrastructure projects that followed in early 2019 have started to deliver a boost to the economy, lifting sentiment after months of gloomy economic data.
>
> But it is unclear how far the uplift will carry through this year. The flow of credit to businesses in China remains weak and demand for exports feeble even as a trade war with the US inches closer to resolution.
>
> Some economists worry that positive signals from March are a seasonal fluke, and that China’s frothy stock market will eventually experience a deep correction as economic growth slows to a three-decade low.

[Does China Have Feet of Clay?](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/five-key-weaknesses-in-china-by-joseph-s--nye-2019-04) <br> *by Joseph S. Nye, from project-syndicate.org, 20190404*

> China’s economic performance over the past four decades has been truly impressive. It is now the main trading partner for more than a hundred countries compared to about half that number for the United States. Its economic growth has slowed, but its official 6% annual rate is more than twice the American rate. Conventional wisdom projects that China’s economy will surpass that of the US in size in the coming decade.

> Perhaps. But it is also possible that Xi has feet of clay.
>
> No one knows what China’s future holds, and there is a long history of faulty predictions of systemic collapse or stagnation. While I don’t think either is likely, the conventional wisdom exaggerates China’s strengths. Westerners see the divisions and polarization in their democracies, but China’s successful efforts to conceal its problems cannot make them go away. Sinologists who know much more than I do describe at least five major long-term problems confronting China.

## China-US

[Why Europe Is Getting Tough on China](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-04-03/why-europe-getting-tough-china) <br> *by Andrew Small, from foreignaffairs.com, 20190403*

> As next week’s EU-China summit approaches, Europe has begun to fundamentally rethink its China policies. The shift is so substantial than even seasoned Asia hands have described it as a [“revolution.”](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/europe-facing-china-copernican-revolution) Despite differences among the EU member states, the overall thrust of the change is in convergence with the new U.S. approach. As recently as three years ago, member states resisted even modest changes to strengthen EU trade defense instruments, despite the flood of Chinese steel imports. The notion of an EU-level mechanism to scrutinize Chinese investments was still anathema to most European leaders. If the United States in early 2016 had suggested closer coordination in restricting Chinese access to Western technologies, a common public front on China’s non-market practices, or cooperation on infrastructure financing as a counterbalance to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), European allies would have responded with a bemused rebuff.
>
> The same logic that has driven the U.S. policy shift, however, has led Europe to change its stance. In March, European heads of state debated a new European Commission strategy paper that describes China as an “economic competitor in the pursuit of technological leadership, and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance.” The proposals in the paper would change policies in areas ranging from procurement to data, antitrust rules to telecommunications, industrial strategy to artificial intelligence.

[Are Russia and China Really Forming an Alliance?](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-04-04/are-russia-and-china-really-forming-alliance) <br> *by Leon Aron, from foreignaffairs.com, 20190404*

> In March of 1969, Chinese troops ambushed and killed a Soviet border patrol on an island near the Chinese-Russian border. Fighting on and near the island lasted for months and ended with hundreds of casualties. Fifty years later, the ferocity of the skirmish between Mao Zedong’s China and Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union seems to belong to a very distant past—so distant, indeed, that many foreign-policy [experts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-beijing-moscow-axis-11549036661) are convinced that an anti-U.S. alliance between the two countries is [emerging](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/china-and-russia-strategic-alliance-making-38727). Yet even half a century on, such an assessment stretches the evidence beyond what it can bear. On closer inspection, Chinese-Russian economic, foreign policy, and military cooperation is less than impressive. The history of relations between the two countries is fraught, and they play vastly different roles in the world economy, making a divergence in their objectives all but unavoidable. In short, reports of a Russian-Chinese alliance have been greatly exaggerated.

[The Improbable Rise of Huawei](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/03/the-improbable-rise-of-huawei-5g-global-network-china/) <br> *by Keith Johnson, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190403*

> In less than a decade, allegedly thanks in part to billions of dollars in support from the Chinese government, the privately held Huawei has become the world’s largest telecom equipment company, last year posting more than $107 billion in revenue from operations in some 170 countries. 
>
> More important, Huawei has, by most accounts, taken the lead in the race to develop one of the modern world’s most important technologies: fifth-generation mobile telephony. Unlike its various predecessors, which simply offered consumers the ability to send texts, then to surf the web on their phones, and finally to stream video, 5G promises to revolutionize the entire global economy. 
>
> And for perhaps the first time in China’s modern history, Huawei’s growing market share and technological prowess are putting a champion of the Chinese government in a position to dominate a next-generation technology...
>
> 5G will be, simply put, the central nervous system of the 21st-century economy—and if Huawei continues its rise, then Beijing, not Washington, could be best placed to dominate it.
