## Xinjiang

[China’s hi-tech war on its Muslim minority](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/apr/11/china-hi-tech-war-on-muslim-minority-xinjiang-uighurs-surveillance-face-recognition) <br> *by Darren Byler, from theguardian.com, 20190411*

> China’s version of the “war on terror” depends less on drones and strikes by elite military units than facial recognition software and machine learning algorithms. Its targets are not foreigners but domestic minority populations who appear to threaten the Chinese Communist party’s authoritarian rule. In Xinjiang, the web of surveillance reaches from cameras on buildings, to the chips inside mobile devices, to Uighurs’ very physiognomy. Face scanners and biometric checkpoints track their movements almost everywhere.
>
> Other programmes scan Uighurs’ digital communications, looking for suspect patterns, and flagging religious speech or even a lack of fervour in using Mandarin. Deep-learning systems search in real time through video feeds capturing millions of faces, building an archive that can supposedly help identify suspicious behaviour in order to predict who will become an “unsafe” actor. Actions that can trigger these “computer vision” technologies include dressing in an Islamic fashion and failing to attend nationalistic flag-raising ceremonies. All of these technological systems are brought together in the Ijop, which is constantly learning from the behaviours of the Uighurs it watches.

> In her recent study on [the rise of “surveillance capitalism”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook), the Harvard scholar Shoshana Zuboff notes that consumers are constantly generating valuable data that can be turned into profitable predictions about our preferences and future behaviours. In the Uighur region, this logic has been taken to an extreme. The power – and potential profitability – of the predictive technologies that purport to keep Xinjiang safe derive from their unfettered access to Uighurs’ digital lives and physical movements. From the perspective of China’s security-industrial establishment, the principal purpose of Uighur life is to generate data, which can then be used to further refine these systems of surveillance and control.

[Will the U.S. continue to put national interest over China’s human rights violations?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/04/09/will-us-continue-put-national-interest-over-chinas-human-rights-violations/) <br> *by Charles Kraus, from washingtonpost.com, 20190409*

> The United States government is determining how to respond to this remarkable tragedy. Some members of the public are calling for the Trump administration to invoke the Global Magnitsky Act and impose financial sanctions and travel bans against the Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuse in Xinjiang. Others have suggested such a move could hurt U.S. efforts to engage China over other important issues like North Korea, trade and climate change.
>
> This is not the first time that the United States has had to choose how to respond to discomforting developments in Xinjiang, nor is it the first time that that choice has involved whether to put broader American-Chinese relations ahead of human rights. Almost 50 years ago when facing these questions, the Nixon administration prioritized pragmatic geopolitical calculations over human rights considerations. This choice gave the Chinese Communist Party a pass over its treatment of Muslim minorities, in the process illuminating the moral costs of such calculations.

## Slowdown

[Xi Jinping’s China seeks to be rich and communist](https://www.ft.com/content/671a8fdc-57ca-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1) <br> *by Martin Wolf, from ft.com, 20190409*

> Today, China is not quite exceptional. True, the number of countries ruled by a party that calls itself communist is far smaller than it was before 1991. Yet there remain a few others, notably Vietnam. True, too, it has achieved four decades of staggering economic growth. Yet it is still a middle-income country, ranked by the IMF at 75th in the world, in gross domestic product per head at purchasing power parity — a little behind Mexico and Thailand.
>
> In terms of quality of governance, too, it is not extraordinary, at least on standard World Bank indicators. As one would expect, it ranks far higher for “government effectiveness”, on which it is ranked close to Italy, than for “voice and accountability”, on which it is below Russia. But it is not really exceptional among middle-income countries. If, however, it were to become a high-income country, with GDP per head at, say, the level of South Korea but with government accountability where it is today, something quite new would have emerged. After all, even Singapore’s “voice and accountability” is ranked far higher than China’s.

> Will China turn itself into a huge Singapore, with high-income levels of prosperity and government effectiveness, but retain one-party rule? Or will its political system, economic progress or, more plausibly, both together, founder? Will Mr Xi go down in history as the man who brought China to the top of the world, or as a Chinese version of Leonid Brezhnev, whose conservatism brought the Soviet system into irretrievable disrepair? It is impossible to know how this will end. The Chinese alone will decide. We only know that it matters for us all. Meanwhile, the west has to look within, to repair its failing democratic system.

[‘China’s Manhattan’ Borrowed Heavily. The People Have Yet to Arrive.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/business/china-economy-debt-tianjin.html) <br> *by Alexandra Stevenson & Cao Li, from nytimes.com, 20190410*

> Welcome to Yujiapu Financial District, which promotes itself as China’s Manhattan, but may better be seen as a monument to the breakdown of the Chinese growth model. Four-fifths of the office space stands empty. Construction on other buildings has stopped, leaving skeletons in the sky. A sprawling mall has few shoppers. Inside, a pet store has no animals.

>
> China has long borrowed heavily to build and then counted on breakneck economic growth to pay it back. The script: Sell vast amounts of land to developers, borrow to subsidize construction, and jobs and new cities will result. It was a model that helped China build its skyscrapers and high-speed rail lines and ushered in an era of prosperity.
>
> But China is not growing as fast as it used to, and it is not clear that the “build it and they will come” model will save Yujiapu and other places with big debts. The national government now must find other ways to spur growth — without making the debt problem worse.

> Huang Lincai is a cheery 23-year-old with a lot of optimism — even though he recently lost his job.

> That youthful confidence of always being able to find work is not unusual in China these days. A younger generation has come to expect prosperity. They increasingly look for personal fulfillment as well.

> Yet as the Ford layoffs show, economic warning signs are starting to emerge in China. Inflation has [gradually crept up](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/business/china-prices-inflation.html). Economic growth has [slowly eroded](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/business/china-economy-gdp-fourth-quarter.html).

> What makes the current optimism of young people like Mr. Huang so striking, and the livability of today’s city so surprising, is that Chongqing has experienced a grim history over much of the past century. The beauty and orderliness now contrast with a violent past.
