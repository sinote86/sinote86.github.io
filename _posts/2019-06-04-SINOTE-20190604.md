## 1989

[The Morning After](https://chinachannel.org/2019/06/04/tiananmen-memories/) <br> *by Anna Wang, from chinachannel.org, 20190604*

> The morning after, Radio Beijing reported the Tiananmen Massacre. 
>
> Years later, a friend of mine told me that as he listened to the broadcast, he pulled his curtains tight and hid in the pitch black of his room. Rumor had it soldiers would open fire on any sign of life. Even a flick of a light switch could get you killed. He kept his radio as low as possible. 
>
> *This is Radio Beijing. Never forget June 3, 1989: the most tragic event in the history of the nation’s capital.* 
>
> Radio Beijing was a shortwave station. Its signal was easily scrambled by electronic interferences. Machines in neighboring factories, streetcars, combustion engines, and even desk lamps could distort the signal. But that morning, the city lay in darkness, and nearly all modern conveniences stopped functioning. The sound of Radio Beijing was crystal clear.
>
> Tears rolled down my friend’s face.
>
> I missed the broadcast. Gunshots continued until two in the morning, before a silence fell heavily upon the city. Exhausted, I couldn’t help but doze off in the embrace of the blackout.

[30 Years After Tiananmen: How the West Still Gets China Wrong](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/06/04/30-years-after-tiananmen-how-the-west-still-gets-china-wrong/) <br> *by Melinda Liu, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190604*

> Each year, around the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square bloodshed, Beijing feels like a parallel universe. On the surface, everything’s normal. Under the surface, people use elaborate metaphors to refer to the June 1989 violence. Political dissidents disappear. Internet access, virtual private networks used to access the uncensored internet, and social media accounts get twitchier than normal. People are on edge. Yet rarely does the June 4 bloodletting—during which hundreds, possibly thousands, of protesters were killed by government forces—merit official mention. This week, as I watched television news footage of protesters being fired upon in Sudan, it felt like a flashback to the carnage and chaos of Beijing all over again.

> This year, on the 30th anniversary of Tiananmen, Beijing’s mood feels especially weird. China’s relationship with the West—especially the United States—today evokes the big chill that epitomized the June 4 aftermath. Thirty years ago, many Western governments slapped economic sanctions against China—depriving it of precious advanced technologies—and condemned the regime’s human rights abuses. Societal controls tightened. Activists were jailed. Many Chinese officials with reformist tendencies were purged. And the regime sought to erase the Tiananmen crackdown from China’s collective consciousness.

> Thirty years after Chinese soldiers killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of demonstrators in Beijing and other cities, memories of the violence remain fraught, with China detaining activists, tightening censorship and denouncing calls for a full accounting of the bloodshed.
>
> The 30th anniversary of the June 4 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters was tense in China on Tuesday, the strain heightened by a trade war with the United States and worries that Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city that holds the largest public vigil for the dead, is losing its singular status and freedoms.

> Security forces have been deployed throughout Tiananmen Square in Beijing, 30 years on from a deadly crackdown on student demonstrators in the city that marked one of the darkest chapters in the country’s history.
>
> Plainclothes and uniformed police patrolled the perimeter of the square, where crowds of tourists waited for security personnel to scan their ID cards. An armoured police car was stationed along a street leading to the square. Asked about the extra checks, a police officer said: “Today is a bit special.”
>
> Foreign journalists were not allowed to enter the square and plainclothes police blocked reporters from taking photos by opening umbrellas in front of them. Major foreign news sites that had not been previously blocked in China, including CNN, Reuters, and Bloomberg, could not be accessed on Tuesday.

> Even after this city returned to Chinese control in 1997, it has traditionally held the largest annual vigil for the Tiananmen protesters killed in the government’s crackdown. It is home to the only museum dedicated to the events of 1989.
>
> But as Beijing’s influence has increased, one of the greatest reservoirs of those memories — Hong Kong’s publishing industry — is imperiled. On the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, people who produce books documenting it and other key moments in Chinese history fear they will soon be driven out of business.
>
> “Independent publishing has been reduced to a nonprofit activity for preserving some important historical documents, memoirs and recollections,” said Bao Pu, the founder of New Century Press, one of the few surviving Hong Kong publishers focusing on modern China. “Otherwise it would be gone.”

[How the Tiananmen Massacre Shocked, Then Inspired a Chinese Political Cartoonist](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/world/asia/china-tiananmen-cartoonist-badiucao.html) <br> *by Amy Qin, from nytimes.com, 20190604*

>  The political cartoonist Badiucao still remembers the sultry Shanghai afternoon when he stumbled upon a video about the Tiananmen massacre of 1989 — and his world turned upside down.
>
> It was 2007, and he and his law school roommates had been watching a pirated movie when suddenly it cut to a [documentary](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gate/) that was apparently spliced in. The three-hour film first showed crowds of young Chinese holding pro-democracy banners in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Then Chinese army tanks rolled into the city and troops began firing on the people.
>
> During the military campaign, which began on the night of June 3 and ended the next day, hundreds or perhaps thousands were killed.
>
> The four roommates, all in their early 20s, sat in the dark, speechless. Until that moment, Badiucao recalled, he had been just another good, apolitical kid from a working-class Shanghai family. He was only 3 years old during the crackdown, but seeing the soldiers turn their guns on the students and civilians, he said, felt personal, like “dropping from heaven to hell.”
