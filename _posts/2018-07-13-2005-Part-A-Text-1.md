Everybody loves a fat pay rise[^2]. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking[^3], you might even be outraged[^4]. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too[^5] human”, with the underlying[^6] assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance[^7]. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in *Nature*, suggests that <u>it is all too monkey</u>, as well.

[^5]: **all too —** <br> used to emphasise that sth is the case to an extreme or unwelcome extent; much too: <br>  - *These problems have been occurring all too often.* <br>  - *Here is a story of our times - one which is all too common and all too regrettable.* <br>

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin[^8] monkeys, ~~which have all the necessary ingredients to capture the public imagination~~. They look cute. They are good-natured[^9], co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily[^10]. Above all, like their ~~finicky~~[^11] female human counterparts[^12], they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services” than males ~~(although why this is so remains a mystery)~~.

[^9]: **good-natured** /ˌɡʊdˈneɪtʃəd/ adj. <br> kind, friendly and patient when dealing with people; naturally kind and helpful and not easily made angry: <br>  - *Anthony is so good-natured—he finds it difficult to hate anyone.* <br>

[^12]: **counterpart** /ˈkaʊntəpɑːt/ n. <br> a person or thing that corresponds to or has the same function as another person or thing in a different place or situation: <br>  - *The minister held talks with his French counterpart.* <br>

Such characteristics make them perfect candidates[^13] for Dr Brosnan's and Dr de Waal's study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens[^14] for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to **swap**[^15]`/exchange` pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining[^16] chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting in return[^17] for its rock, their behaviour became markedly[^18] different.

[^13]: **candidate** /ˈkandɪdət/ n. <br> a person or thing regarded as suitable for or likely to receive a particular fate, treatment, or position: <br>  - *The novel must be a prime candidate for the award.* <br>  - *Your father is an obvious candidate for a heart attack.* <br>
[^14]: **token** /ˈtəʊk(ə)n/ n. <br> a metal or plastic disc used to operate a machine or in exchange for particular goods or services <br> **PS** **token** /ˈtəʊk(ə)n/ n. <br> a thing serving as a visible or tangible representation of a fact, quality, feeling, etc: <br>  - *The number eight is a token of fortune in Chinese and has special favour across the country.* <br> 1. **by the same token** <br> in the same way or for the same reason: <br>  - *Pressure is a funny thing - it can be used as a very positive force and by the same token, can be very destructive.* <br> 2. **in token of** <br> as a sign or symbol of: <br>  - *Adults exchanging drinks around a pub bar in token of temporary friendship.* <br>
[^15]: **swap** /swɒp/ v. [*with object*] <br> give (one thing) and receive something else in exchange: <br>  - *I'll swap my sandwich for your popcorn. = I'll swap you my sandwich for your popcorn.* <br>  -  *We spent some time **swapping stories** about our college days.

In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant[^19] to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed[^20] her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (**in the absence of**`/without` an actual monkey able to eat it) was enough to induce **sullen[^21] behaviour** /`resentment`[^22] in a female capuchin.

[^19]: **reluctant** /rɪˈlʌkt(ə)nt/ adj. <br> unwilling and hesitant; **disinclined**: <br>  - *Today, many ordinary people are still reluctant to talk about politics.* <br> **SYN** **disinclined** /dɪsɪnˈklʌɪnd/ adj. <br> unwilling; reluctant: <br>  - *All parties and institutions are affected by a climate of cynicism and mistrust in which society is disinclined to believe whatever it is told by authorities and experts.* <br>
[^20]: **toss** /tɒs/ v. <br> throw (sth) somewhere lightly or casually: <br>  - *Jonnie shuts the phone and casually tosses it onto the dresser.* <br> **PS** **toss** /tɒs/ v. <br> throw (a coin) into the air in order to make a decision between two alternatives, based on which side of the coin faces uppermost when it lands: <br>  - *A coin will be tossed to determine who will make the first opening statement.* <br>
[^21]: **sullen** /ˈsʌlən/ adj. <br> bad-tempered and **sulky**; gloomily or resentfully silent or repressed: <br>  - *Dick just sat there with a sullen expression on his face, refusing to speak.* <br> **SYN** **sulky** /ˈsʌlki/ adj. <br> **morose**, bad-tempered, and resentful; refusing to be cooperative or cheerful: <br>  - *He **lapsed into** a sulky/sullen silence.* <br> `> lapse into < pass gradually into (an inferior state or condition)` <br>  - *He was morose, pessimistic, obsessed with achieving the perfect style.* <br> **PS** **sullen** /ˈsʌlən/ adj. <br> (of the sky) full of dark clouds; dark and unpleasant: <br>  - *a sullen [=gloomy] sky/morning* <br>
[^22]: **resentment** /rɪˈzɛntm(ə)nt/ n. <br> **bitter** indignation[^24] at having been treated unfairly: <br>  - *He's filled with resentment at/against his boss.* <br>  - *She bore/felt/harbored **bitter** feelings of resentment toward her ex-husband.* <br> `> bitter < /ˈbɪtə/ adj. feeling or showing anger, hurt, or resentment because of bad experiences or a sense of unjust treatment` <br> **PS** **resent** /rɪˈzɛnt/ v. [*with object*] <br> feel bitterness or indignation at (a circumstance, action, or person): <br>  - *They resent us for our power and at the same time expect us to be capable of everything.* <br> **resentful** /rɪˈzɛntf(ə)l/ adj. <br>  - *Bitter, resentful and increasingly unstable, Jackie watches her life **crumble**.* <br> `> crumble < /ˈkrʌmb(ə)l/ v. [no object] (of sth abstract) disintegrate gradually over a period of time` <br>  - **resentful of/at/about sth** *They seemed to be resentful of our presence there* <br>

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous[^23] indignation[^24], it seems, are not the preserve[^25] of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly[^26] clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved[^27] independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems[^28] from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.

[^23]: **righteous** /ˈrʌɪtʃəs/ adj. <br> morally right or justifiable: <br>  - *But an opposition leader capable of righteous anger is essential for any democratic legislature.* <br>
[^24]: **indignation** /ɪndɪɡˈneɪʃ(ə)n/ n. [*mass noun*] <br> anger or annoyance provoked by what is perceived as unfair treatment: <br>  - *He was full of **righteous indignation** about the attack.* <br> `> righteous indignation < the belief that you are right to be angry even though other people do not agree` <br>
[^25]: **preserve** /prɪˈzəːv/ n. <br> a sphere of activity regarded as being reserved for a particular person or group: <br>  - *But some are beginning to participate in an activity once thought to be the preserve of technology geeks and political **partisans**.* <br> `> partisan < /ˌpɑːtɪˈzan/ n. a strong supporter of a party, cause, or person` <br>
[^26]: **abundantly** /əˈbʌnd(ə)ntli/ adv. <br> extremely: <br>  - *I believe I've made it **abundantly clear** that this is a pointless retelling of an old story.* <br> **PS** **abundantly** /əˈbʌnd(ə)ntli/ adv. <br> in large quantities; **plentifully**: <br>  - *The plant grows abundantly in the wild.* <br>
[^27]: **evolve** /ɪˈvɒlv/ v. <br> (with reference to an organism or biological feature) develop over successive generations as a result of natural selection: <br>  - *The domestic dog is thought to have evolved from the wolf.* <br> **PS** **evolve** /ɪˈvɒlv/ v. <br> develop gradually: <br>  - *Her company has evolved from a hobby into a thriving business.* <br>  - *If you want to be a poet, you must evolve your own style of writing.* <br>
