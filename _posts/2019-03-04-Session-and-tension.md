## Crackdown

[Xi Jinping Works to Stifle Dissent Amid Concerns About China’s Economy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-jinping-works-to-stifle-dissent-amid-concerns-about-chinas-economy-11551609000) <br> *by Chun Han Wong, from wsj.com, 20190303*

> While Mr. Xi remains undisputedly in charge, party watchers say his maneuvers point to disquiet within the government and political elite. Critics say the president’s policies have failed to shore up the slowing economy, unnecessarily aggravated tensions with the U.S. and alienated many other foreign governments. Meanwhile, they say, his insistence on control and threats to punish wayward officials are creating a policy muddle on the economy and sowing confusion in the bureaucracy.

> A test of Mr. Xi’s authority will unfold over the next two weeks, when roughly 3,000 lawmakers gather in Beijing to review the government’s economic blueprint for a year full of politically challenging anniversaries. While some, like the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic, are auspicious, several others are not, like the 30-year mark since the deadly suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests.

> China’s largest political event of the year, a meeting of legislative delegates and political advisers known as the “two sessions”, gets under way this week and comes at a time when Chinese leader Xi Jinping faces one of the most challenging periods since coming to power.
>
> Thousands of delegates will descend on the Great Hall of the People in Beijing while authorities go into overdrive to prevent any semblance of dissent during the two weeks of meetings of the nearly 3,000-strong National People’s Congress (NPC) , and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory body.
>
> Xi faces public scrutiny against the backdrop of a slowing Chinese economy, a bruising trade war with the US, heightened international concern over Chinese tech firm Huawei, and growing global criticism over Chinese policies in Xinjiang.

## China-US

[The China debate is here to stay](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/03/04/the-china-debate-is-here-to-stay/) <br> *by Richard C. Bush, from brookings.edu, 20190304*

> What comes after the Trump administration is less clear. While there has been growing intensity and activism on China from the populist and nationalist wings, there is not yet an American consensus on China. Public polling data by Gallup, Pew, and the Chicago Council affirms this point. For a significant majority of Americans, China is not a central concern or preoccupation.
>
> The lack of public support for a confrontational approach toward China will continue to constrain risk-taking vis-à-vis China. In the absence of public coalition-building for a more aggressive approach toward China, it will be difficult for policymakers to sustain a purely confrontational approach. As the Trump administration’s efforts to use tariffs to compel Chinese capitulation on trade frictions has made clear, the bilateral relationship is a two-player game, and China has ample tools to retaliate against American actions. Unless the American public is persuaded of the need to make material sacrifices to blunt China’s rise, they will grow weary of accepting direct economic pain now for the uncertain prospect of long-term gain. This is a point the Chinese know well and use to their advantage.

> The lesson for the world is that America can’t be trusted. Why bother making deals with a country that’s willing to slap sanctions on the best of allies, and clearly lie about the reasons, whenever it feels like it?
>
> Meanwhile, the sudden retreat in the confrontation with China shows that we talk loud but carry a small stick. It would be one thing if the U.S. had changed course on the merits. But backing down so easily, after all the posturing, tells the world that the way to deal with America is not to bargain in good faith, but simply to threaten the president’s political base, and maybe offer some payoffs, political and otherwise. (I’m still wondering about those floors China’s largest bank rents at Trump Tower.)
>
> And when it comes to payoffs, autocracies have an advantage over nations that observe the rule of law. China appears to be getting most Trump tariffs removed; Canada still faces those steel tariffs.
>
> Finally, by undermining the international system, America is making the world worse for itself as well as for everyone else. In fact, payback is coming right away.

[Kazakhs Won’t Be Silenced on China’s Internment Camps](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/04/961387-concentrationcamps-china-xinjiang-internment-kazakh-muslim/) <br> *by Reid Standish & Aigerim Toleukhanova, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190304*

> The plight of ethnic Kazakhs in China has become the source of growing uproar inside Kazakhstan, with the testimonies of former detainees such as Auelkhankyzy fueling a growing guerrilla advocacy campaign inside the Central Asian country of 18 million people. The grassroots effort has turned authoritarian Kazakhstan, which has been overseen by President Nursultan Nazarbayev since 1989, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, into an unlikely battleground for the truth about the political indoctrination camps in Xinjiang.
>
> The groundswell has also left the Kazakh government walking a tightrope between appeasing Beijing—a strategic, economic, and political partner—and quelling an increasingly exasperated segment of the population focused on the fate of their relatives and ethnic brethren in neighboring China. The Kazakh government has avoided criticizing China and publicly toes Beijing’s line about the camps, but behind the scenes, Kazakh diplomats have grown increasingly active in working for the release of the country’s own citizens and ethnic Kazakh Chinese citizens with ties to Kazakhstan.
>
> Interviews conducted by Foreign Policy with 60 other people in Kazakhstan, including former detainees, those with firsthand knowledge of the re-education camps, and people who believe their relatives are in detention in Xinjiang, show the devastating imprint of the camps and how powerful public outrage has been.
