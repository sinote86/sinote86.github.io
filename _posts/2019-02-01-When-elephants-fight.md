## China-US

[China Counts the Costs of Its Big Bet on Venezuela](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-counts-the-costs-of-its-big-bet-on-venezuela-11549038825) <br> *by Jeremy Page, from wsj.com, 20190201*

> When China hatched the first of a series of oil-for-loans agreements with Venezuela in 2007, it seemed like a perfect match. Venezuela had the world’s biggest oil reserves; China was poised to become the biggest energy consumer.
>
> Twelve years and more than $50 billion in loans later, a political crisis in Venezuela is threatening China’s payout and drawing Beijing into a proxy standoff as it supports a Venezuelan leader the U.S. is intent on toppling. It is a conflict with Washington that Beijing could do without, amid efforts to resolve a trade dispute that is weighing on the Chinese economy.
>
> Venezuela’s deepening crisis is also damaging China’s credibility in Latin America, while fueling criticism abroad—and debate at home—about its overseas lending, as other nations also face debt problems linked to Chinese loans.

> When elephants fight, the grass is trampled. Today, Canada is the grass. It is caught in the US war on Huawei, one of China’s iconic businesses. Canada has done everything right. Nevertheless China has detained two Canadians, apparently in retaliation against the perfectly correct response of Canada’s judicial system to a US extradition request. This saga has big implications, for the US, for China, for foreigners who work in China and for the other law-governed democracies. The latter should take note of it and react.

> For China, however, this action against such a prominent individual is both offensive and humiliating. After Ms Meng’s arrest, China duly threatened Canada with “serious consequences” and detained two Canadians, including a former diplomat, on vague charges of “harming national security”. These men appear to be hostages. China presumably wishes not only to punish Canada for its temerity, but to persuade it to release Ms Meng. Yet Canada’s government cannot just do what China wants. It has the rule of law — a concept communist China does not seem willing to understand.

> Now, a half century later, the tables have turned, and the two nations are forging a new bond—with the U.S. as their common rival once again. China today is an export-driven economic giant with ambitions for world leadership, embodied in President Xi Jinping’s quest for a global “community of shared destiny.” Russia, for its part, has been ostracized by the West for President Vladimir Putin’s adventurism and remains deep in the economic doldrums. The former superpower has been forced to adjust to life as China’s junior partner and occasional supplicant.

> Yet over the past year, President Donald Trump’s determined effort to roll back China’s world-power aspirations—and to restrict its trade and access to technology—has nudged Beijing closer to Moscow. Despite its many structural weaknesses, Russia is increasingly valued by Beijing because of its diplomatic clout, remaining military might and weapons know-how...

> Even as the relationship has blossomed, however, the two nations grow less equal with each passing day. In fact, when viewed in historical terms, the Russia-China dynamic represents one of the world’s most dramatic reversals in the balance of power.

## Slowdown

[Apple Takes a Hit in China, and Workers There Feel the Pain](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/apple-china-iphone-jobs.html) <br> *by Ailin Tang, from nytimes.com, 20190201*

> More than a hundred Chinese workers who once assembled and tested Apple iPhones queued up on a recent morning outside Gate 7 of the vast Changshuo electronics factory to collect their severance and go on their way. They had once hoped that their assembly line jobs would give them big enough paychecks to propel them into a better life.
>
> That was before consumers in China turned up their noses at Apple’s new iPhone XR and its nearly $1,000 price. Work slowed. Overtime evaporated. And now workers are giving up.
