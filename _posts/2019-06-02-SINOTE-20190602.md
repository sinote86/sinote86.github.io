## 1989

[China’s other Tiananmens: 30 years on](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/02/chinas-other-tiananmens-30th-anniversary-1989-protests) <br> *by Lily Kuo, from theguardian.com, 20190602*

> [Tuesday marks 30 years since](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/31/tiananmen-square-anniversary-what-sparked-the-protests-in-china-in-1989) the Chinese military cleared student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds – possibly thousands – of unarmed protesters, as well as bystanders, local workers and residents trying to protect the students.

> The Chinese leadership has worked to erase this chapter from the collective memory, omitting it from history books, censoring all mentions of “6/4” online, jailing those who were involved, as well as detaining any who attempt to memorialise it.
>
> Perhaps at even greater risk of being forgotten are the pro-democracy protests that took place in more than 300 Chinese cities at the time. These lesser-known student movements contributed to the government’s ultimate decision to crack down in Tiananmen Square. Their legacy remains today, as authorities go to lengths to ensure such demonstrations don’t happen again.

> The Chinese student protests in the spring of 1989 are remembered mostly for how they ended — the bloody military assault around Tiananmen Square in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed. But the pro-democracy movement spread far beyond Beijing before it was crushed. More than 1,000 miles away in Chengdu, a sprawling metropolis in southwest China, as in scores of other cities across the country, young workers and students concerned with corruption and unemployment gathered to demand accountability and democracy.
>
> News cameras from around the world recorded the Tiananmen crackdown, but there were far fewer journalists in these other cities. In Chengdu, however, was a 28-year-old Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan who was in the region conducting research and sent dispatches to a newspaper in Detroit.

> That student, **Andy Levin**, was elected to Congress in November and now represents Michigan’s Ninth District. On the 30th anniversary of the protests, we asked Mr. Levin to shake out his old notebooks and share his memories. His account has been edited and condensed.

> Such was the sense of liberal post-Cold War triumph at the time that many Western countries, especially the United States, saw no reason any longer to contain the animal spirits of free enterprise with much government regulation. This was also the message brought to post-communist Europe by various evangelists of neoliberalism.
>
> China appeared to be the outlier. Apart from such backwaters as Cuba and North Korea, only there had Communist rule prevailed. China continued to be ruled by the Communist Party of China. But was that really a victory for communism? In fact, what emerged intact from the massacre of defenseless students and other citizens was not really communism at all, but Deng Xiaoping’s version of authoritarian capitalism.

> For the 660,000 Chinese students overseas, stumbling across these hidden episodes in their country’s history for the first time can be extraordinarily discombobulating, as if the axis of the world has suddenly shifted out of whack. For some, such discoveries are so disturbing that it is easier to discount them as Western conspiracies designed to undermine the Communist Party.
>
> These overseas students are part of China’s post-Tiananmen generation, raised in the era of patriotic education, which emphasizes China’s century of national humiliation at the hands of the Western and Japanese colonial powers. History has become an ideological tool, with certain episodes celebrated for showing the party’s best version of itself, while others are rooted out and erased. The narrative that runs throughout this discourse is China’s modern-day renaissance, driven by its refusal to be bullied by outside powers. All of this is in the ultimate service of legitimizing the current leadership.

> When army tanks crushed protests by students and workers in Beijing on June 4 1989, one of the casualties was a 33ft-high papier-mâché “Goddess of Democracy” that for many symbolised the spirit of the movement.
>
> Thirty years later, [young Chinese](https://www.ft.com/content/dae2c548-4226-11e8-93cf-67ac3a6482fd) enjoy many of the benefits that the protesters sought: freedom to travel abroad, freedom to choose their own jobs and a respite from the daily burdens of corruption and inflation. 
>
> But far from seeking democracy — another right their elders demanded — they are instead growing disenchanted with the US amid a protracted trade war and a sense that China is finally America’s equal on many fronts.
