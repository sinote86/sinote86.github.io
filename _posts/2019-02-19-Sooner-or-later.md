## China-US

[China’s slow reforms stack odds against multinationals](https://www.ft.com/content/a3117e40-3427-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812) <br> *by Tom Mitchell, from ft.com, 20190219*

> It is hard to imagine now but when China acceded to the World Trade Organization more than 17 years ago, China UnionPay did not exist. The state-owned card payments monopoly was created in March 2002, three months after the WTO formally welcomed the country as a member.
>
> Almost two decades later, Visa and Mastercard’s wait to pass through the gates to enter the world’s largest card payments market seems set to end. It is inconceivable that US president Donald Trump would sign off on a trade deal with Beijing that did not finally resolve the impasse.
>
> But when the US card companies finally do enter China, they will confront a radically different market from the one that beckoned in December 2001. And unfortunately for many other multinationals, their frustrating China experience is not an unusual one. In industry after industry, foreign companies have been allowed in only after local champions have secured unassailable positions — or after new technologies and competitors have totally changed the market landscape.

[China will not surpass America any time soon](https://www.ft.com/content/7f700ab4-306d-11e9-80d2-7b637a9e1ba1) <br> *by Joseph Nye, from ft.com, 20190219*

>No country — including China — is about to usurp the US’s place in the world in terms of overall power. Russia is in demographic decline and is heavily dependent on energy exports; India and Brazil, each with $2tn economies, remain developing countries. And while a tactical alliance of convenience exists between Russia and China, a real alliance of authoritarians such as existed in the 1950s is not likely. Thus, while rapid Asian economic growth has meant a power shift in the region, Chinese power inside Asia is balanced by Japan, India and Australia, among others. And the US will remain crucial to that balance.

>Overall, Chinese behaviour does not suggest that it is trying to overthrow a world order from which it benefits, but is rather seeking to increase its influence in it. However, this could change as Chinese power grows.

[Taiwan tensions call for restraint from big powers](https://www.ft.com/content/9db0a780-3109-11e9-ba00-0251022932c8) <br> *by The editorial board, from ft.com, 20190219*

> Taiwan exists in the precarious space between the ambitions of two superpowers. China threatens to attack the island if it declares independence, while the US is legally obliged to help with its defence. For most of the past 40 years, the tensions in this triangular relationship have been largely contained. In recent months, however, stresses have intensified to a point where they may imperil the delicate coexistence.
>
> Such strains derive from a nexus of issues. The majority of democratic Taiwan’s 23m people want their island’s self-determination to be recognised by Beijing. But China insists that Taiwan is a breakaway province that must be re-absorbed. The US has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan but treats it as a virtual ally. Meanwhile, Washington’s rivalry with Beijing deepens.

## Feature

[In Central Asia’s forbidding highlands, a quiet newcomer: Chinese troops](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-central-asias-forbidding-highlands-a-quiet-newcomer-chinese-troops/2019/02/18/78d4a8d0-1e62-11e9-a759-2b8541bbbe20_story.html) <br> *by Gerry Shih, from washingtonpost.com, 20190218*

> Two miles above sea level in the inhospitable highlands of Central Asia, there’s a new power watching over an old passage into Afghanistan: China. 
>
> For at least three years, Chinese troops have quietly monitored this choke point in Tajikistan just beyond China’s western frontier, according to interviews, analysis of satellite images and photographs, and firsthand observations by a Washington Post journalist.
>
> While veiled in secrecy, the outpost of about two dozen buildings and lookout towers illustrates how the footprint of Chinese hard power has been expanding alongside the country’s swelling economic reach.

> Tajikistan — awash in Chinese investment — joins the list of Chinese military sites that includes Djibouti in the strategic Horn of Africa and man-made islands in the South China Sea, in the heart of Southeast Asia.

> Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s economic ambitions over the past seven years have brought a wave of [major investment projects,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/a-would-be-city-in-the-malaysian-jungle-is-caught-in-a-growing-rift-between-china-and-its-neighbors/2018/09/10/d705cb18-b031-11e8-9a6a-565d92a3585d_story.html) from the resource-rich Caspian Sea to Cambodia’s coastline.

> The modest facility in Tajikistan — which offers a springboard into Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor a few miles away — has not been publicly acknowledged by any government.

> But its presence is rich in significance and symbolism.

## Interview

[‘It’s Hopeless But You Persist’: An Interview with Jiang Xue](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/02/19/its-hopeless-but-you-persist-an-interview-with-jiang-xue/) <br> *by Ian Johnson, from nybooks.com, 20190219*

> The forty-five-year-old investigative journalist Jiang Xue is one of the most influential members of a group of journalists who came of age in the early 2000s, taking advantage of new—if temporary—freedoms created by the Internet to investigate pressing social issues. She worked at *Chinese Business View* (*Huashangbao*) until 2014, when she quit as its opinion-page editor over censorship. Since then, she has kept writing to an ever-shrinking audience on social media, most notably[ about the wives of several high-profile civil rights lawyers](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/A_Year_as_a_Wife) who have been arrested. 
>
> Jiang lives in Xi’an, the northwestern Chinese city I recently visited to explore how public intellectuals in the provinces are surviving the current crackdown on civil society and independent thinking. I found a thriving, if small, community of free thought centered on a public arts and speaking space called *Zhiwuzhi*, which is the Chinese for the Socratic paradox “I know that I know nothing.” Jiang is also a mainstay of this space, helping to suggest speakers and regularly attending events with her friend, the videographer Tiger Temple (interviewed [previously in the *NYR Daily*](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/01/30/my-responsibility-to-history-an-interview-with-zhang-shihe/)) and *Zhiwuzhi*founder Chen Hongguo.  
>
> Jiang talked about how Mao’s Great Leap Forward famine shaped her family, the heyday of independent media in China, and her faith as a devout Buddhist, which sustains her in what she feels is a hopeless cause.
