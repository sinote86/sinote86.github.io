[To Many Chinese, America Was Like ‘Heaven.’ Now They’re Not So Sure.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/asia/china-america-trade.html) <br> *by Amy Qin, from nytimes, 20190518*

> Even in China’s authoritarian political system, public opinion must be carefully managed. If leaders push an anti-American message too far, they run the risk of nationalist sentiment spiraling out of control. That would limit their options in talks with Washington by forcing them to adopt a tough posture.
>
> Though China has ways to prop up its economy, there are deep-seated concerns that it is not ready for a prolonged standoff, which could exact a heavy toll on people’s livelihoods. That could ultimately backfire on the party, which has staked its legitimacy on generating continuous economic growth.
>
> On the other hand, if Chinese leaders act too cautiously, they could look inept to a domestic populace that has, in recent years, become more self-assured about China’s status as a rising power.
>
> What was once starry-eyed enthusiasm for America among many Chinese has given way to sober admiration, if not outright disillusionment, as people have gotten to know the United States better and its problems have come into clearer view.

[As Huawei Loses Google, the U.S.-China Tech Cold War Gets Its Iron Curtain](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/business/huawei-trump-china-trade.html) <br> *by Li Yuan, from nytimes, 20190520*

> If China and the United States have begun [a technological Cold War](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/technology/trump-china-tariffs-tech-cold-war.html?module=inline), then the Huawei order can best be seen as the beginnings of a digital Iron Curtain. In this potential vision of the future of technology, China will continue to keep out much of the world. The United States and many other countries, goes this thinking, will in turn block Chinese technology.
>
> The tougher American stance is closing off many of the ways that the United States and China exchanged ideas and did business despite [the strict Chinese censorship regime](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/internet-censorship-in-china?module=inline). Those closed doors could have profound effects not only on the business of technology, but also on how the world will use and understand the devices and services of the future. 
>
> Already, China’s censorship and tight control of its citizens’ digital lives have effectively isolated one-fifth of the world’s internet-using population, [giving rise to a generation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/china-generation-blocked-internet.html?module=inline) that doesn’t know what it means to Google something or to subscribe to a YouTube channel. 
>
> The aggressive new stance by the United States will only speed up that process, opening a potential window to a day when Chinese people can use only Chinese phones and gadgets powered by homegrown chips and software. All this is happening with a speed that has shocked many in China. 

[The Trade War Is Just the Beginning](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/whats-next-us-china-trade-war/589852/) <br> *by Matt Peterson, from theatlantic.com, 20190520*

> The further the administration goes, the less the dispute falls into the neat policy toolbox and the more it seems like a wholesale push to contain China. “There are many reasons why the United States is not off the mark in terms of going after Huawei,” Elizabeth Economy, a China watcher at the Council on Foreign Relations, said on a call with reporters Thursday. “But I think this last step does speak very directly to the Chinese, sort of the U.S. is trying to contain our growth and our rise as an economic superpower. I think it takes it a little bit over the line.”
>
> Ask an economist what they fear, and the response starts with the dreaded D-word: “decoupling.” The U.S. and China could forcibly unravel their closely intertwined economies. “You’ve already seen an increasing amount of that, whether it’s various chips that people are trying to source elsewhere, [or] whether it’s Foxconn going to India,” said Christopher Balding, an associate professor of economics at Fulbright University Vietnam. (Huawei [claims](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-huawei-analysis/tall-chip-tale-huaweis-backup-plans-leave-experts-unconvinced-idUSKCN1SN0YN) it already has plans to build chips elsewhere. On the other end of the trade war, Apple supplier Foxconn is [looking to India](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/business/china-us-trade-disengage.html) for new factories.)

[As Trump escalates China trade dispute, economic ties lose stabilizing force in matters of national security](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-trump-escalates-china-trade-dispute-economic-ties-lose-stabilizing-force-in-matters-of-national-security/2019/05/19/61d50abc-78da-11e9-ac17-284a66782c41_story.html) <br> *by Paul Sonne, from washingtonpost.com, 20190520*

> The United States for years relied on economic interdependence with China as a stabilizing force in relations with Beijing, with business between the two nations forming what former treasury secretary Hank Paulson [used to call](http://fortune.com/2015/11/16/hank-paulson-us-china-green-project/) the “ballast” in U.S.-China affairs.
>
> But as President Trump escalates his trade dispute with Chinese President Xi Jinping, there is a realization that those days are gone. The result is a reduced incentive for stability and restraint in Washington when it comes to China, raising the possibility that tensions could extend beyond the trade sphere and impact other areas of contention, including Taiwan or the South China Sea.  

[Could the US-China trade row become a global cold war?](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/20/us-china-trade-war-donald-trump-xi-jinping) <br> *by Nouriel Roubini, from theguardian.com, 20190520*

> Despite the mutual awareness of the Thucydides trap – and the recognition that history is not deterministic – China and the US seem to be falling into it anyway. Though a hot war between the world’s two major powers still seems far-fetched, a cold war is becoming more likely.

> ...
>
> Regardless of which side has the stronger argument, the escalation of economic, trade, technological, and geopolitical tensions may have been inevitable. What started as a trade war now threatens to escalate into a permanent state of mutual animosity. This is reflected in the Trump administration’s [national ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf)[security ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf)[strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf), which deems China a strategic “competitor” that should be contained on all fronts.

> A full-scale cold war thus could trigger a new stage of deglobalisation, or at least a division of the global economy into two incompatible economic blocs. In either scenario, trade in goods, services, capital, labour, technology and data would be severely restricted, and the digital realm would become a “splinternet,” wherein western and Chinese nodes would not connect to one another.
