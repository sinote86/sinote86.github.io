> China’s economy is about 12 per cent smaller than official figures indicate, and its real growth has been overstated by about 2 percentage points annually in recent years, according to [research](https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/a-forensic-examination-of-chinas-national-accounts/).

> The findings in the paper published on Thursday by the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, reinforced longstanding scepticism about Chinese official statistics. 
>
> They also add to concerns that China’s slowdown is more severe than the government has acknowledged. Even based on official data, China’s economy grew at its slowest pace since 1990 last year at 6.6 per cent.

> Over the past two years, Chinese negotiators have also repeatedly believed they had a deal, only for it to come apart at the last minute. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the summer of 2017 presented a plan, which Mr. Trump quickly disavowed. They thought they had an understanding with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last year, focused on cars and financial services, and then Mr. Trump imposed tariffs.
>
> It’s a difficult position for the Chinese, who want to avoid an embarrassment. Mr. Trump is unpredictable, and China can’t be assured he won’t change his mind when the two presidents meet.
>
> But the Chinese also recognize that a presidential summit meeting may be the only path to completing a deal, since Mr. Trump has a tendency to undercut his advisers...

[China's women's movement has not only survived an intense crackdown, it's grown](https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/mar/07/chinas-womens-movement-has-not-only-survived-an-intense-crackdown-its-grown) <br> *by Leta Hong Fincher, from theguardian.com, 20190307*

> While prominent male human rights activists have emerged over the years (most notably, the Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in custody in 2017), very few ordinary Chinese citizens knew about them or could relate to their abstract goals.
>
> By contrast feminist activists today take up causes that are not directly confronting Communist party rule, but have broad resonance with millions of young, urban women across China, such as sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and gender discrimination in employment and university admissions.
>
> The feminist activists have cultivated a networked community numbering into the thousands, revolving around university students and graduates. They have become effective organisers and arguably pose a larger, more complicated challenge to the communist regime than the male activists who preceded them.

[With Streaks of Gray Hair, Xi Jinping of China Breaks With Tradition](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-gray-hair.html) <br> *by Javier C. Hernández, from nytimes.com, 20190307*

> President Xi Jinping is known for breaking the rules of Chinese politics, amassing more power than any leader since Mao.
>
> His latest attempt to shake things up may be one of his boldest moves yet: Mr. Xi is going slightly — though unabashedly — gray, in defiance of longstanding Communist Party tradition.

> For decades, Chinese leaders have sported unnaturally black heads of hair, a look that symbolized unity and gave the party a youthful veneer.
>
> But Mr. Xi, 65, appears to be dispensing with vanity as he presents himself as a relatable and avuncular leader, part of his efforts to soften his hard-line policies.

[‘China Could Have Been a Very Different Country.’ A Search for Family Reveals a Lost Moment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-could-have-been-a-very-different-country-a-search-for-family-reveals-a-lost-moment-11551974189) <br> *by Te-Ping Chen, from wsj.com, 20190307*

> In the tumultuous years of the early 20th century, after China’s last imperial dynasty was overthrown, many Chinese hoped to build a new, democratic era. My great-grandfather—an outspoken poet who ran a newspaper that advocated passionately for the rights to free speech and a free press—was among them. 
>
> The Communist Party changed all that after it took power in 1949, splitting apart families and silencing those who disagreed with its path. Before then, I was able to find a long public record of my great-grandfather’s life and activities. Then he essentially vanished.
>
> We lose histories. We lose them because of time, because nothing was written or what was written was lost, because our families flee, fight or simply forget. In China, as in the case of my family and others, we also lose them because of the Communist Party. 
>
> My great-grandfather’s story is a poignant testimonial to paths not taken, offering a brief glimpse of a moment when China could have become a very different country.
