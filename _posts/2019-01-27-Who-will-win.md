[America Pushes Allies to Fight Huawei in New Arms Race With China](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/huawei-china-us-5g-technology.html) <br> *by David E. Sanger, Julian E. Barnes, Raymond Zhong & Marc Santora, from nytimes.com, 20190126*

> Over the past year, the United States has embarked on a stealthy, occasionally threatening, global campaign to prevent Huawei and other Chinese firms from participating in the most dramatic remaking of the plumbing that controls the internet since it sputtered into being, in pieces, 35 years ago.
>
> The administration contends that the world is engaged in a new arms race — one that involves technology, rather than conventional weaponry, but poses just as much danger to America’s national security. In an age when the most powerful weapons, short of nuclear arms, are cyber-controlled, whichever country dominates 5G will gain an economic, intelligence and military edge for much of this century.

> The Chinese telecom company Huawei is at the centre of an increasingly tense standoff between China and the US.

> What began as a trade spat and grievances over corporate intellectual property theft has developed into a global standoff involving “hostage diplomacy”, death sentences and allegations of Chinese espionage.

> “There are so many doubts about Huawei,” said Li Datong, an outspoken commentator and former journalist. “That Huawei is able to expand and hold a large share of the market has people wondering what other power there is behind the company? Everyone knows the answer,” he said.

[Trade Talks Spotlight Role of China’s State-Owned Firms](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trade-talks-spotlight-role-of-chinas-state-owned-firms-11548504001) <br> *by Bob Davis, from wsj.com, 20190126*

> China started overhauling its state-centric economic model 40 years ago under Deng Xiaoping. After joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, Beijing pushed further to wean the economy off state-owned firms. But under President Xi Jinping they have re-emerged as a centerpiece of his economic policies and a stumbling block for U.S. negotiators.

> Mr. Xi and his allies see state firms as a source of employment and thus social stability and a way for China to compete internationally through national champions in steel, aluminum, construction and other fields.  They are also an important lever to manage the economy, in part because the Communist Party plays a big role in selecting top managers.

> As President Trump presses on with the trade war, observers say he hasn’t wrapped his head around China. The miscalculation is expected to have costs.

## Slowdown

[Just How Much Is China’s Economy Slowing?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/25/the-challenges-of-chinas-slowing-economy-xi-trump-trade-gdp/) <br> *by Keith Johnson, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190125*

> The problem is that nobody (well, [almost](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-25/china-s-latest-official-gdp-report-is-accurate-no-really) nobody) trusts the official Chinese economic data, including especially its GDP figures. That’s because economic growth, and the statistics to back it up, is more a political target in China than a reflection of the true state of the economy. And for years, Chinese officials at all levels of government cooked statistics to meet those political objectives.

> Getting a handle on what’s really going on with the world’s second-largest economy is hugely important for multinational firms, such as auto companies or Apple, which have to make investment decisions based on expectations of demand from China’s massive internal market. And properly understanding just how resilient the Chinese economy is matters a great deal to policymakers around the world; a sudden slowdown could accelerate domestic political aggravation for Xi and the Communist Party, which has relied on supercharged growth to keep its population quiescent.

> China’s bike-sharing start-ups have followed a strategy that is common among the country’s tech companies, from ride-sharing to food delivery to online payments. Companies raise significant funds and funnel the investment into subsidising consumers, with the aim of dominating the market and ultimately ramping up prices.
>
> The business model is so prevalent that bankers have coined a new term to describe it: rather than B2B — business to business — or B2C — business to consumer — the start-ups are dubbed VC2C — venture capital to consumer.
>
> But many in the industry are now questioning whether the strategy is sustainable, especially as bike-sharing looks to be on its last legs.
