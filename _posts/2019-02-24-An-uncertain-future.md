## Crackdown

[China’s Entrepreneurs Are Wary of Its Future](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/business/china-entrepreneurs-confidence.html) <br> *by Li Yuan, from nytimes.com, 20190223*

> For more than a generation, China has been fueled by optimism that, despite its problems, tomorrow will be better than today. Now, the prevailing view is best summed up by an online meme made popular by Wang Xing, the founder and chief executive of Meituan Dianping, the online delivery and takeout company. The year 2019, goes the meme, may be the worst year in this decade, but it will be the best year in the next decade.

> China’s economy is slowing, and the trade war with the United States has pinched growth. But many entrepreneurs are more broadly worried that China won’t pursue the economic and political liberalization it needs. On the contrary, since Xi Jinping took control of the Communist Party in 2012, the party has increased its dominance in every aspect of Chinese society.

> Many members of the business elite are unhappy that the leadership’s economic policies favor state-owned enterprises even though the private sector drives growth. They are angry that the party is trying to put a Mao-era ideological straitjacket on an economy driven by private enterprises and young consumers. They are upset that the party eliminated term limits last year, raising the prospect that Mr. Xi could become president for life.

> Many businesspeople feel increasingly insecure, especially as some entrepreneurs are “disappeared” by the government to assist in the anticorruption campaigns.

[China’s About-Face on Education](http://chinamediaproject.org/2019/02/24/44492/) <br> *by Elaine Wang, from chinamediaproject.org, 20190224*

> In late January, *Introduction to Constitutional Law* (宪法学导论), a textbook on China’s Constitution first published in 2004 and now in its third edition, vanished from online bookstores, including Amazon.cn, JD.com and dangdang.com. Offline, the book was apparently pulled from shelves at Xinhua Bookstore, a government-affiliated book chain that is also the country’s largest.

> The book’s sudden change of fate is one of the latest and clearest indications of a deeper ideological shift in China under Xi Jinping (习近平), one that puts Marxism — with “Chinese characteristics,” of course — back in the driving seat, with real and felt implications for all aspects of society, including education.

> Whatever the backstory concerning Zhang’s book, the news of its disappearance came amid a nationwide operation targeting college textbooks.

## Xinjiang

> China’s Xinjiang policy came up in Friday’s discussions between president Xi Jinping and visiting Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. “China has the right to take antiterrorism and de-extremisation measures for safeguarding national security,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in its account of the meeting published this weekend. “The Saudi side respects and supports that and is willing to strengthen co-operation with China.”
>
> Deputy foreign ministry Zhang Hanhui briefed diplomats and officials from 80 countries and international organisations about China’s policies on Friday, presenting them as “development achievements” that are “worthy of praise”.

> China’s goal is to use these technologies to suppress dissent, and to predict and snuff out any challenge to the ruling Communist Party’s grip on power. In Xinjiang, surveillance is part of a policy of cultural genocide. In addition to the camps and cameras, Mr. Xiao says the government has issued guidelines to collect DNA samples from all Xinjiang residents between ages 12 and 65.

> When George Orwell’s “1984” was published seven decades ago, it seemed a dire warning of a future dystopia ruled by thought police and authoritarian control. Today, such a world is becoming a reality in Xinjiang. We agree with human rights groups who have urged the United Nations Human Rights Council, when it meets starting Monday, to launch an international fact-finding mission to Xinjiang to expose this unsettling experiment in state control of human behavior.
