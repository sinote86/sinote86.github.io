> The Trump administration rejected an offer by two Chinese vice-ministers to travel to the US this week for preparatory trade talks because of a lack of progress on two key issues, highlighting the difficulty that Washington and Beijing will face in trying to reach an agreement by a deadline of March 1.
>
> This week’s planned trip by Wang Shouwen and Liao Min was intended to pave the way for a higher-level meeting in Washington on January 30 and 31 by Liu He, China vice-premier, and Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative. 
>
> But, according to people briefed on the negotiations, US officials cancelled this week’s face-to-face meetings with Mr Wang, a vice-minister of commerce, and Mr Liao, a vice-minister of finance, because of a lack of progress on “forced” technology transfers and potentially far-reaching “structural” reforms to China’s economy.

> American officials say they will seek to have Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom firm Huawei who was detained in Canada on Dec. 1, sent to the United States. They have until Jan. 30 to make the request.

> China has already expressed alarm about the detention of Ms. Meng, a Chinese citizen and a daughter of the founder of Huawei, whose arrest set off a diplomatic crisis involving the United States, Canada and China. Ms. Meng is currently living with her family at one of her homes in Vancouver. In December, a Canadian court ruled that Ms. Meng would not have to be held in jail, but said that the authorities could closely monitor her, and that certain parts of Vancouver were off limits.

> In Britain, for example, Huawei set up a special corporate board, led by John Browne, a former chief executive of the oil giant BP. It donated to schools, including Cambridge University; held parties for political leaders; and sponsored prominent charities such as the Prince’s Trust, founded by Prince Charles. In Germany, Huawei opened facilities to conduct research on new innovations and sponsored events, including the recent convention of Germany’s governing Christian Democratic Union party.

> European governments have been welcoming. Last year, after Huawei announced a five-year commitment to spend 3 billion pounds, or about $3.8 billion, to expand in Britain, where the company employs 1,500 workers, Prime Minister Theresa May met in Beijing with Sun Yafang, Huawei’s chairwoman. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany posed for pictures at the company’s booth at a trade show last year.

[China’s ability to make computer chips still ‘years behind’ industry leaders](https://www.ft.com/content/a002a9e4-1a42-11e9-b93e-f4351a53f1c3) <br> *by Edward White, from ft.com, 20190122*

> Semiconductor sector analysts believe that China’s best chipmakers are as much as a decade behind their international rivals. That is despite long running financial support from Beijing, rising market dominance of Chinese electronics hardware groups and the vastly improved capabilities of China’s chip design companies.

> Beijing’s poor use of state funds slowed the sector’s development historically and a hardening attitude in the west toward Chinese acquisitions of semiconductor companies, technology and talent, had in recent years dragged on China’s ability to catch up, experts said.

> The gap is likely to widen further because of the increasingly higher costs of chip making equipment and of the research and development needed to produce the most advanced processors — used in applications such as high-performance computing, high-end mobile and gaming devices and artificial intelligence.
