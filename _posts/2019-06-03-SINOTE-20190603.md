## 1989

[Thirty Years After Tiananmen: Someone Always Remembers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/opinion/tiananmen-china.html) <br> *by Ian Johnson, from nytimes.com, 20190603*

> Since then, the government has tried its best to make 6/4 a non-date. Every year, in the month or two leading up to the day, it rounds up dissidents, [harasses victims’ relatives](https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tries-to-supress-memory-of-tiananmen-massacre/3361856.html), silences journalists and stations soldiers on street corners. If pushed to explain its position in 1989, the government argues that the students were radicals who had to be cleared away and that any violence was initiated by them or their defenders, who attacked soldiers, burned tanks and [created chaos](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/06/what-does-the-chinese-government-say-happened-at-tiananmen-square.html).

> That is, of course, a classic blame-the-victim argument — hardly credible and slightly repulsive. But on some level it has taken hold. As the journalist Louisa Lim describes in her 2014 book, “[The People’s Republic of Amnesia](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-peoples-republic-of-amnesia-9780199347704?cc=us&lang=en&),” most Chinese people are unaware of the massacre, and among those who know of it, some see it as a regrettable, embarrassing outlier — perhaps as some Americans might see [the My Lai massacre](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/ghosts-my-lai-180967497/) in South Vietnam in 1968.

> And yet the memory of that night in Beijing three decades ago hasn’t died away. Many people feel [a sense of outrage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/world/asia/china-tiananmen-square-massacre.html?module=inline): There was no justification for using armed soldiers, and decades of supercharged economic growth will not wash away the stain left by that reckless decision, not until there is some sort of apology or reckoning.

> Thirty years since the Tiananmen Square protests, China’s economy has catapulted up the world rankings, yet political repression in the country is harsher than many who watched those events would have anticipated.
>
> Hundreds of thousands of Muslims are held in re-education camps without charge, student activists face relentless harassment, and dissident leaders have been locked up or simply vanished.
>
> Religious groups face ever greater pressure to conform, and a web of mass surveillance is bolstering a system many call totalitarian. It’s a far cry from the hopes of the idealistic student demonstrators, and a level of control far beyond what many imagined possible, even after the army’s bloody crushing of the protests on the night of June 3-4, 1989.

> Mr. Zhou was one of four young intellectuals who helped save lives by negotiating the evacuation of protesters from the square. Thirty years later, Mr. Zhou, 72, is among the few prominent actors from the protests who remain in China and continue to defend the hopes of the 1989 movement, even while agonizing over its lessons.
>
> Mr. Zhou often ponders the choices he made that culminated in the escape from Tiananmen Square. His life, closely watched by the state security officers, has become a difficult vigil for the democratic ideals that electrified the protests 30 years ago, he said.
>
> Stifling censorship has enforced a silence over those who try to keep alive the memory of the protests and massacre, and has scrubbed the internet in China of virtually any references to the upheavals. The country has become increasingly authoritarian under Xi Jinping, the leader of the ruling Communist Party, whose administration has rounded up [rights lawyers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/world/asia/china-wang-quanzhang-human-rights.html?module=inline), [labor activists](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/world/asia/china-workers-protests.html?module=inline), [students](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/world/asia/china-marxist-students.html?module=inline) and Muslim [ethnic minorities](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html?module=inline).

[Beijing, Berlin and the two 1989s](https://www.ft.com/content/b125bcb6-85d6-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2) <br> *by Gideon Rachman, from ft.com, 20190603*

> In the US and Europe, the year 1989 is synonymous with the fall of the Berlin Wall. But there were two 1989s. Five months before the wall came down, the Chinese military entered [Tiananmen Square](https://www.ft.com/content/3867e336-7bc1-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560) and crushed the pro-democracy movement. The 30th anniversary of that bloody event falls this week. 
>
> Watching from the west at the time, the dramatic events in Berlin seemed more globally significant than what had happened in Beijing five months earlier. China was just one country, albeit a large one; and it was still poor and under-developed. It was the Soviet Union that had been the second superpower throughout the cold war, and the Soviet empire had just collapsed. The cold war was over. The west had won. Democracy had won. In the great sweep of history, Berlin would surely matter more than Beijing.
>
> Thirty years on, that verdict looks much more doubtful. It now seems possible that future historians will conclude that the most significant event of 1989 was the crushing of the Tiananmen uprising, not the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was Tiananmen that secured the Chinese Communist party’s grip on power, thus ensuring that the rising power of the 21st century would be an autocracy not a democracy.

[China’s Complacent Generation](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/06/03/chinas-complacent-generation/) <br> *by Michael Auslin, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190603*

> The lack of knowledge, combined with an increased focus on securing one’s material well-being, has created an apathy about the possibility of large-scale, fundamental reform. That’s especially true given that the regime still gets credit for China’s extraordinary growth over the past generation, a sentiment fueled in part by a nationalism that pits China against the world.
>
> Yet as public dissatisfaction over current trends and concern for the future grow, the increasingly authoritarian government is not prepared to let the two landmark dates pass unmanaged. In overturning the post-Mao model of leadership largely based on consensus, Xi has assiduously promoted his vision of society while squeezing any independent civil-society movements. His Han nationalism and repeated references to the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” allow for no skepticism, let alone alternative views on the appropriate path for Chinese development.
