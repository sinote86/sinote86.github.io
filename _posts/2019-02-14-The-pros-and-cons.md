## China-US

[Trump’s Trade Warrior Takes the Fight to Beijing](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/13/donald-trump-bob-lighthizer-china-trade-225025) <br> *by Edward Alden, from politico.com, 20190213*

> Lighthizer is leading the U.S. delegation to Beijing this week for what will be the most critical meeting yet in the high-stakes trade conflict between the United States and China. He is tasked with persuading or bullying Chinese leaders into what are euphemistically called “structural reforms,” policy changes that somehow force China off its path of using state power to capture new industries and supplant U.S. leadership in the critical technologies of the future.

> If he somehow succeeds, he could put the world’s two superpower economies on a path toward accommodation. If he fails, the U.S. faces either a drawn-out trade conflict with China, or an admission of defeat that there is little it can do to change Beijing’s economic strategy.

> I’ve always thought Americans would come together when we realized that we faced a dangerous foreign foe. And lo and behold, now we have one: China. It’s become increasingly clear that China is a grave economic, technological and intellectual threat to the United States and the world order.
>
> And sure enough, beneath the TV bluster of daily politics, Americans are beginning to join together. Mike Pence and Elizabeth Warren can sound shockingly similar when talking about China’s economic policy. Nancy Pelosi and Republicans sound shockingly similar when they talk about Chinese human rights abuses. Conservative and liberal policy thinkers can sound shockingly similar when they start talking about how to respond to the challenge from China.

## Crackdown

> “The objection of many on China’s new left — not just students — is that China is a socialist country in name but capitalist in reality, and that inequality, pollution and corruption are a consequence of this anomaly,” says Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history at the University of Oxford.
>
> The [state’s concerted oppression](https://www.ft.com/content/0bdbeff6-64a7-11e8-90c2-9563a0613e56) of young Marxists partly reflects the tension within the Chinese Communist party’s own origin story: that it has not preserved the communist ideals behind its revolutionary success under Chairman Mao. In 1978 the party formally ditched the idea of class struggle, deeming it too divisive, and instead prioritised economic development.

> “The students’ commitment to a purer form of Marxism only serves to highlight the CCP’s own drift from its roots,” says Jude Blanchette, author of a forthcoming book on China’s neo-Maoists. “This, crucially, has been why the left in China has always presented more of a challenge to the party leadership than the right.”

> Under his rule, the Communist Party has been waging its toughest campaign against dissent and liberal values since the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests nearly 30 years ago. In 2015 police rounded up hundreds of lawyers and legal activists who had been trying to help citizens use the courts to reverse injustices perpetrated by officials—the kind of cases that, as Mr Zhang says in his textbook, touch on constitutional matters, not just ordinary legal ones. Many of the detainees have been released but banned from doing legal work and kept under surveillance. Some have been tried and imprisoned. The final related trial ended on January 28th with the sentencing of Wang Quanzhang, a human-rights lawyer, to four-and-a-half years in prison for “subversion”.

> Now the party is focusing more closely on campuses, where many legal scholars still support constitutionalism. The party is right: the word for this, *xianzheng*, is often just a veiled way of referring to Western-style democracy, or at any rate just the nice bits of the constitution. In January the Ministry of Education ordered every university to report to the authorities which textbooks they were using for constitutional studies. It said reasons for this “thorough investigation” included a need to “implement Xi Jinping Thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era” and “revise and improve textbooks in a timely manner”.

> How can, and how will, the Party leverage digital technology to re-program propaganda in the 21st century?
>
> Already this year we have witnessed one product that provides at least part of the answer, a prime example of how the Party can leverage digital media products to reshape the whole process of ideological control in ways that are far more personal, and far more effective, than anything we have witnessed in the reform era. As the *People’s Daily* reported on January 15: “On New Year’s Day, many Party members and cadres found to their delight that ‘Xi Study Strong Nation,’ an authoritative and content-rich platform especially for theoretical study, had formally been launched,” the [official *People’s Daily* reported on January 15](http://www.xinhuanet.com//zgjx/2019-01/15/c_137744407.htm).

> Skirting past this questionable assertion about the delight Party members have derived from this new app, what exactly are we talking about here?
