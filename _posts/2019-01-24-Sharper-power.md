## Sharp power

[China Says Australian Writer Is Suspected of National Security Crimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/world/asia/australia-china-yang-hengjun-writer.html) <br> *by Chris Buckley and Damien Cave, from nytimes.com, 20190124*

> The Australian government confirmed on Wednesday that Mr. Yang, 53, had been detained. But the severity of the charges against him was unclear until Thursday, when Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Beijing that Mr. Yang was suspected of crimes related to “state security.” She referred to Mr. Yang as Yang Jun, and later said that was his officially registered name.
>
> Beijing’s state security bureau detained Mr. Yang “on suspicion of criminal activities endangering national security,” Ms. Hua said at a regularly scheduled news briefing. “Currently, the case is still under investigation under the law.”
>
> Ms. Hua did not say what specific crimes Mr. Yang was accused of. But “endangering national security” is a sweeping set of potential charges that include espionage and political subversion. Two Canadians were detained in China on the same broad accusation last month.

> George Soros launched a searing attack on China’s president Xi Jinping, singling out advancements in artificial intelligence in the hands of repressive regimes as a “mortal threat” to societies around the world.
>
> In a provocative [speech](https://www.georgesoros.com/2019/01/24/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-economic-forum-2/) at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the billionaire philanthropist and proponent of open societies said China was not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it was the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced.
>
> “This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of open societies,” he said.

[Why China is lavishing money on foreign students](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/01/26/why-china-is-lavishing-money-on-foreign-students) <br> *from economist.com, 20190124*

> In countries such as Britain, Australia and America, foreign students are welcomed mostly because universities can make more money out of them than out of locals. In China it is the opposite. Foreign students enjoy big subsidies. Often they are more generously treated than local students. Last year the Ministry of Education budgeted 3.3bn yuan for them, 16% more than in 2017. The rich world is selling education. China is using it to buy influence.
>
> The cheerful Pushtuns are one manifestation of China’s strategy. Another are the more than 500 Confucius Institutes which the government has set up on campuses around the world. Offering heavily subsidised classes in Mandarin, the institutes have aroused suspicions in the West that China may be using them to exert political influence. Such worries have prompted several universities in Europe and America to close them. There has been far less resistance to China’s stepped-up efforts to bring students to its own territory and, it hopes, to influence them there.

[South China Sea: Fishing on the front line of Beijing’s ambitions](https://www.ft.com/content/fead89da-1a4e-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21) <br> *by John Reed, from ft.com, 20190124*

> For Vietnam and China the fight over fishing rights represents something bigger. It provides a volatile subtext to their often tense relations, with visceral anti-Chinese sentiment running deep in a country that won a border war against its larger neighbour in 1979.
>
> Vietnam’s communist leadership has a strong relationship with Beijing, a leading trading partner, even as it builds closer ties with the US, Russia and other countries. Yet Hanoi is also one of the most strident voices in south-east Asia that speaks out against China’s unilateral actions in the sea.
>
> Hanoi does, however, choose its words carefully, in part due to the widespread Sinophobia in the country. Anti-China protests have broken out several times in recent years, catching Hanoi off guard and representing an unpredictable element for a government that is in most respects firmly in control.

## Xinjiang

[Inside the Vast Police State at the Heart of China’s Belt and Road](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-01-24/inside-the-vast-police-state-at-the-heart-of-china-s-belt-and-road) <br> *by Peter Martin, from bloomberg.com, 20190124*

> Far-flung Xinjiang is critically important to President Xi Jinping’s loftiest goal: completing China’s return as one of the world’s great powers. Although it represents just 1.5 percent of China’s population and 1.3 percent of its economy, Xinjiang sits at the geographic heart of Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative. It’s a trillion-dollar plan to finance new highways, ports and other modern infrastructure projects in developing countries that will connect them to China’s markets—and, skeptics say, put them in China’s debt for decades to come.
>
> The government has spent vast sums building up cities in Xinjiang to attract companies and fuel growth in the relatively poor region. Concerns about lawlessness in Xinjiang could chill investment. China's campaign against the Uighurs is aimed in part at reassuring wary investors that Xinjiang is a safe place to live and work.
>
> ...
>
> But while Xi builds Xinjiang into a platform to project global influence, he risks undercutting his efforts to present China as a defender of free markets and international rules. Already, the surveillance tactics used in Xinjiang are spreading throughout China. Facial-recognition cameras, internet monitoring and experiments with so-called social credit systems to grade citizens based on behavior are becoming commonplace. And they are not just targeted at Muslims, but at anyone who threatens the Communist Party’s hold on power or is perceived to stand in the way of China’s geopolitical goals.
