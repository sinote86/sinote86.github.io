[Frustration, Miscalculation: Inside the U.S.-China Trade Impasse](https://www.wsj.com/articles/frustration-miscalculation-inside-the-u-s-china-trade-impasse-11557692301) <br> *by  Lingling Wei, Vivian Salama, Michael C. Bender & Bob Davis, from wsj.com, 20190513*

> Bridging the trade rift may ultimately [depend on the personal chemistry between President Trump and President Xi](https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-leaders-new-tactic-to-read-u-s-policy-skip-the-diplomats-and-talk-to-trump-11552581757?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=6&mod=article_inline) and their willingness to push matters forward after months of negotiations that have been full of positive intentions but thwarted by miscalculations, accusations of backtracking and unfulfilled expectations.
>
> At stake are the rules for global trade in a world order upended by China’s rapid rise, and both sides are keen to project an image of strength. The longer the dispute lingers, though, the greater the risk of economic fallout for both countries, along with prolonged uncertainty for global stock markets, which have whipsawed as expectations for a deal ebb and flow. The accelerating 2020 presidential campaign also promises to add a volatile new dynamic to the equation.

[America is the revisionist power on trade](https://www.ft.com/content/e9cc014a-755c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) <br> *by Gideon Rachman, from ft.com, 20190513*

> Both [China and America](https://www.ft.com/us-china-trade-dispute) are dissatisfied with the current world order. The nature of their unhappiness is very different. But the two countries’ rival ambitions have produced a trade war that now threatens globalisation.

> ...
>
> The two presidents’ complaints about the world system are thus mirror images of each other. Mr Xi wants to change the world’s strategic order, and to do that he needs to maintain its economic order. Mr Trump wants to preserve the strategic order, and to do that he needs to change the economic order.
>
> America and China are therefore both revisionist powers. And they are also both status quo powers. America is the status quo power on geopolitics, so it has become the revisionist power on economics. China is the revisionist power on geopolitics, so it has become the status quo power on trade.

[Xi Jinping’s China: why entrepreneurs feel like second-class citizens](https://www.ft.com/content/fcb06530-680a-11e9-9adc-98bf1d35a056) <br> *by Tom Hancock, from ft.com, 20190513*

> After two decades of near double-digit expansion in gross domestic product from the early 1990s, China’s economy has been more subdued for most of this decade. That slowdown has become more pronounced — last year’s 6.6 per cent increase in GDP was the weakest since 1990 — a process that has deep implications for business, society and politics in the world’s second-largest economy. 
>
> The deteriorating sentiment among private business owners such as Mr Liu strikes at the heart of one of the causes of slower growth. Many entrepreneurs believe that decades of economic reform has stalled — and in some cases gone into reverse — since China’s President Xi Jinping assumed leadership of the country in 2012. The phrase they often use to describe the shifting mood is *guo jin min tui*, meaning “the state advances as the [private sector retreats](https://www.ft.com/content/37ac5f08-5529-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1).”

[China’s Latest Crackdown Target Is Liberal Economists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-05-11/china-s-latest-crackdown-target-is-liberal-economists) <br> *by Matthew Campbell & Peter Martin, from bloomberg.com, 20190511*

> Unirule is the brainchild of [Mao Yushi](http://english.unirule.cloud/people/2017-03-03/344.html), a respected 90-year-old economist who was among the first scholars to spread free-market ideas such as deregulation and privatization within China. Until recently, the think tank was one of the country’s more influential nongovernmental organizations, benefiting from the relative liberty granted to economics since the rule of Deng Xiaoping, who once declared that he didn’t care “if the cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice.” So long as they stayed mostly clear of politics, scholars were free to discuss Western thinkers and how their ideas applied to China. The result was a vibrant intellectual community that interacted with government decision-makers, providing data-driven reality checks for officials with little experience outside the Communist Party.
>
> That space has shrunk drastically under President Xi Jinping, who has forcefully reasserted the party’s power and the state’s economic role, and has attacked the civil society that emerged under his predecessors. A crackdown on dissent that began shortly after he took office in 2012 has seen Unirule, which has a small but consequential following among entrepreneurs and academics, hounded almost into oblivion. Its Chinese website and social media accounts have been shut down, its events broken up, and some of its staff barred from traveling abroad.
>
> As China navigates the challenges of a slowing economy and a bruising trade war with the U.S., some foreign observers have become alarmed. “Economic decision-making has become incredibly personalized under Xi. An economist who raises questions may be seen as raising questions with Xi personally,” says Julian Gewirtz, a researcher at Harvard and the author of *Unlikely Partners: Chinese Reformers, Western Economists, and the Making of Global China*. He calls the resulting chill “a profound source of risk for China’s future.”

[How an Academic Journal Censored My Review on Xinjiang](https://chinachannel.org/2019/05/13/oil-water/) <br> *by Timothy Grose, from chinachannel.org, 20190513*

> On January 1, 2018, I received a request from *China and Asia: A Journal in Historical Studies*, a new journal sponsored by the academic publisher [Brill](https://brill.com/?lang=en), a respected Dutch publishing house with some 275 journals under its aegis, which claims “over three centuries of scholarly publishing.” The request from the journal was to review Tom Cliff’s book [*Oil and Water*](https://www.amazon.com/Oil-Water-Being-Han-Xinjiang/dp/022636013X/?tag=larbchina-20) – an ethnography about Han settler experiences in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. I agreed, and the review had a generous November 2018 deadline as the journal would publish its first edition in early 2019. The journal’s book review editor is a trusted friend, and I was pleased to read *China and Asia*’s [mission statement](https://brill.com/view/journals/cahs/cahs-overview.xml?lang=en): “Its purpose is to promote communication and exchange among the global Asian studies community, especially among scholars based in Asian countries.”
>
> After receiving several deadline reminders, I submitted the review on November 7, 2018. During those eleven months, the deteriorating situation in Xinjiang weighed heavily on my mind, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uyghurs reported to be [detained in re-education camps](https://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/whats-happening-xinjiang-four-questions-about-chinas-human-rights-crisis). Cliff’s prevailing argument (see my review, which is reproduced in full below) afforded much-needed clarity to the confounding situation in the region. Therefore, I contextualized my review by opening with a paragraph-long discussion of Xinjiang’s “concentration re-education centers.”
>
> The next day, I received a brief message from the book review editor. The editorial staff “suggest a minor change,” he wrote: to delete the entire first paragraph, in which I had outlined the situation in Xinjiang. I opened the edited document to see the first paragraph, as well as the first two sentences of the second paragraph, had been crossed out (see screenshot below)...
