## Slowdown

[China’s economy grows at slowest annual rate since 1990](https://www.ft.com/content/9706b890-1ad7-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21) <br> *by Gabriel Wildau & Emily Feng, from ft.com, 20190121*

> China’s economic growth dropped to its slowest annual rate in almost three decades last year as the US trade war and Beijing’s crackdown on a debt-fuelled corporate spending spree took their toll on Chinese companies and consumers.

> The data published on Monday also showed the Chinese economy was continuing to decelerate, growing just 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, the lowest quarterly rate since the global financial crisis. Growth has now slowed for three consecutive quarters, prompting concern among investors that the country could drag down the global economy.
>
> Beijing has adopted a series of fiscal and monetary stimulus measures since July in an effort to boost investment and spending, but the new data shows that thus far the measures have failed to reverse the slowdown...

> More broadly, many economists have estimated that China’s slowdown is worse than the government’s figures show, citing more detailed data. Some economists estimate growth is just a fraction of the headline figure, though most economists who crunch the figures say the number is only a percentage point or two lower.
>
> The question now is whether an improvement in December will carry over to the start of 2019. Despite the positive signs, China just two weeks ago decided to pump tens of billions of dollars into the financial system, suggesting that it sees a recovery as fragile at best.

> Behind the deepening downturn, the official data show, are a weakening manufacturing sector, lackluster big-ticket investments by both government and businesses, softening property sales and anemic growth in consumer spending. Adding to the gloom are the continued trade tensions between China and the U.S., which have caused companies throughout the country to delay investment and hiring.

> Places like Taizhou and Yancheng, a relatively wealthy city whose annual per-capita gross domestic product is almost 18% above the nation’s average, are used to prospering. So tough times there suggest that China’s economic weakness is deeper than the official data are showing, economists and analysts said.

> Until recently, privately owned companies in China could survive by tapping funds from the country’s enormous shadow banking sector. But shadow financing began to dry up as Chinese officials, led by Vice-Premier Liu He, ramped up a campaign to stabilise debt at non-financial companies, which is estimated at about 300 per cent of GDP. 
>
> Mr Xi and Mr Liu appear to have underestimated US President Donald Trump’s willingness to launch an all all-out trade war with China, which has sapped investor and private-sector investment, and also their ability to force the country’s state-controlled banking sector to direct more lending to non-state companies. 

[The Xi Jinping Slowdown](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-xi-jinping-slowdown-11548103276) <br> *by The Editorial Board, from wsj.com, 20190121*

> President Trump’s tariffs are only part of the economic explanation. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s decision to slow the pace of economic reform has made the economy more vulnerable to such an outside shock. China’s growth has been built in part on dangerous levels of debt, an unsustainable internal migration from poor rural areas to cities, and state-owned enterprises that distort business decisions to goose official GDP data.
>
> China’s economists know all this, and Mr. Xi has talked about addressing the problems. But he has shrunk from the political challenge and reinforced statism more than any Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping’s reforms began in the late 1970s. Mr. Xi’s aggressive mercantalism, favoring Chinese firms at the expense of foreign products and companies, has also soured many on the China market.

## China-US

[Pessimism Looms Over Prospect of a Sweeping China Trade Deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/china-trade-pessimism.html) <br> *by Alan Rappeport, from nytimes.com, 20190121*

> As a critical round of talks with China kicks off next week, the Trump administration is increasingly pessimistic that Beijing will make the kind of deep structural changes to its economy that the United States wants as part of a comprehensive trade agreement, according to officials involved with the talks.
>
> The United States is now weighing whether large Chinese purchases of American goods and more modest economic changes will be enough for a deal to end a damaging trade war between the two nations and help calm volatile markets.

> Warning that China’s arrest of two Canadians has created a dangerous chill for people working on policy and research in that country, more than 100 academics and former diplomats have signed an open letter calling for the two men to be immediately freed.
>
> Made public on Monday, [the letter](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-mr-xi-release-these-two-canadian-citizens/) was an international cry of concern from people who work and study in China, saying the arrests threaten the flow of ideas with Chinese academics and officials that is essential for policy work and research aimed at narrowing international rifts.

## Crackdown

[China’s Xi Warns Party of ‘Serious Dangers’ as Risks Mount](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-21/china-s-xi-calls-for-political-stability-as-economic-risks-mount) <br> *by Bloomberg News, from bloomberg.com, 20190121*

> President Xi Jinping stressed the need to maintain political stability in an unusual meeting of China’s top leaders -- a fresh sign the ruling party is growing concerned about the social implications of the slowing economy.
>
> ...
>
> The meeting was held on the same day that China reported its slowest quarterly economic growth since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009. The data underscored concerns that the decades-long economic expansion that helped the ruling party outlast most other communist regimes may be running out of steam.
>
> Chinese leaders are also coping with a more confrontational U.S. under President Donald Trump, who has slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions worth of dollars of Chinese goods, roiling financial markets around the world. Xi faces added pressure to personally resolve the issues after obtaining a constitutional change that allows him to rule indefinitely.

> For months, a group of outspoken young communists has put China’s leaders on edge, organizing a [fiery campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/world/asia/china-maoists-xi-protests.html?module=inline) for workers’ rights that has evaded the government’s tight political control.
>
> Now the authorities appear to be deploying a new weapon in their efforts to crush the movement: forcing students to watch videotaped confessions in which detained activists say they spread false information and violated the law.
>
> ...
>
> The confessions are the latest escalation in the Chinese government’s efforts to stop the campaign by the young communists, who have proved unusually resilient in the face of repeated crackdowns.
>
> The activists have embraced the ideas of Mao, Marx and Lenin — which students are required to study at Chinese universities — to denounce social inequality in China and to push for greater protections for workers.

[Scientist Who Edited Babies’ Genes Is Likely to Face Charges in China](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/world/asia/china-gene-editing-babies-he-jiankui.html) <br> *by Austin Ramzy & Sui-Lee Wee, from nytimes.com, 20190121*

> A Chinese scientist who claimed to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies “seriously violated” state regulations, according to the results of an initial government investigation reported on Monday by Chinese state media.
>
> The investigators’ findings indicate that the scientist, He Jiankui, and his collaborators are likely to face criminal charges.
>
> Dr. He [shocked the world in November](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html?module=inline) when he announced that he had used Crispr, a powerful gene-editing technique, to alter the genes of human embryos. He produced some data but no definitive proof during his presentation at an international conference in Hong Kong.
>
> The investigation found that Dr. He and his team had edited the genes of human embryos and then implanted the embryos in female volunteers, as he claimed last year. One volunteer gave birth to twin girls in November, and another volunteer is now pregnant, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency.
