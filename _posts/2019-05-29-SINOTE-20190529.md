[Rule of the rigid compromiser](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rule-of-the-rigid-compromiser/) <br> *by Cheng Li & Diana Liang, from brookings.edu, 20190529*

> Portrayals of Xi often emphasize his power and authority, overlooking the reality that he faces challenges both at home and abroad. His dominance of the country’s leadership has not shielded him from criticism or pressure, nor has it allowed him to force through his priorities uncontested. An analysis of Xi’s recent strategic adjustments can help reveal where, how, and why he has selected to compromise. Although some might claim that such adjustments stem from Xi’s failure to achieve his goals, this flexibility, in fact, signals a nimble approach to governance. His overall strategic goals may be relatively unyielding, but the tactics he uses to achieve those ends are not.
>
> In analyzing Xi’s conduct, it is essential to first outline the primary sources of pressure he faces. Analysts must examine Xi’s tactical adjustments across the domains of politics, the domestic economy, and international trade—whether driven by pressure from changes in Washington’s perspective on Beijing or internal discontent with Xi’s leadership. Finally, exploring Xi’s approach to policymaking will highlight important takeaways for American analysts in particular and policymakers around the world in their search for a more effective approach to China.

[June 4, 1989: A personal recollection](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/05/29/june-4-1989-a-personal-recollection/) <br> *by Jeffrey A. Bader, from brookings.edu, 20190529*

> On June 3 to 4, the 27th Army of the PLA cleared out the demonstrations west of and in Tiananmen Square using lethal force. Beijing has never provided a credible accounting of the dead, asserting shortly thereafter that about 300 people were killed. The New York Times estimated deaths at close to 1,000, based on journalist visits to hospitals. Whatever the number, the killings were a shock to China and to the watching world, which had not seen such bloodshed inside China since the Cultural Revolution.

> U.S. officials from across the foreign affairs community gathered at the State Department on the afternoon of June 3 to discuss options in response. A consensus formed for suspending high-level visits and exchanges, suspending military cooperation with China, and opposing most loans to China by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. There was brief discussion of China’s Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status, but no support for denying it. In fact, the State Department had only days earlier sent an annual waiver to the Congress under the Jackson-Vanik law that assured China’s continued MFN eligibility, enabling Chinese goods to continue to enter the United States at the same tariff levels as those of other countries. The meeting’s mood was that the United States had to respond to the massacre with measures that had teeth, but it was imperative not to take steps that might drive China back towards isolation, autarky, and hostility.

[Why Maoism still resonates in China today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/29/why-maoism-still-resonates-china-today/) <br> *by Jeffrey Javed, from washingtonpost.com, 20190529*

> Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a “[new Long March](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1151300.shtml)” in the wake of an [intensifying trade war](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/world/asia/xi-jinping-china-trade.html) with the United States. The historical metaphor evokes a [parallel between Xi and Mao Zedong](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alejandrochafuen/2019/05/23/a-new-long-march-trade-or-war-xi-jinping-evoking-mao-zedong/), who rose to power during the [grueling military retreat](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2039033/long-march-what-it-was-and-why-it-matters) and eventually led the Communist Party to victory over the Nationalists.

> This was not the first time Xi’s [rhetoric](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1537835/xi-jinpings-recollections-sent-down-youth-burnish-man-people) or [policies](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-rural-rejuvenation/to-spur-rural-development-china-to-send-millions-of-students-on-volunteering-trips-idUSKCN1RO17Z) stirred memories of China’s Maoist past. But there’s been little analysis of the complex emotions Mao’s memory — positive and negative — still raise among the Chinese public today, four decades after his death.

> [Our current study](https://www.jeffreyjaved.com/uploads/8/6/1/2/86128854/ding_javed_red_memory_latest.pdf) looks at the looming memory of Mao and the Maoist era. China seems to be experiencing a resurgence of Maoism in recent years, manifest in popular nostalgia for Mao and in Xi’s style of governance.

> For four days starting May 30, almost 3,000 sociologists of law are meeting in Washington for the [annual global convention of the Law and Society Association.](https://www.lawandsociety.org/WashingtonDC2019/Washington2019.html)Fourteen discussion panels will focus on China’s extraordinary modern development but also on the Communist Party’s many massive violations of both international human rights and the country’s own constitutional protections.

> Yet, during these scholarly deliberations, a tragic and mysterious drama continues in China that should attract not only world academic attention but also that of international organizations, government officials, think tanks, NGOs, journalists and other observers concerned about the increasingly Orwellian repression of the Xi Jinping dictatorship.

[Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html) <br> *by Kevin Rudd, from nytimes.com, 20190529*

> When President Trump tweeted on May 5 that the China trade deal was off, the historical echoes in Beijing were loud and clear.  Almost exactly 100 years earlier, China’s [“May Fourth Movement” of 1919](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/opinion/china-may-fourth-movement-protests-1919-wusi.html?module=inline) was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War I. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be returned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti-American, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country.
>
> Thus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time when he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is now full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking the spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare down the vastly superior American military.
