> Trade officials from Washington and Beijing are seeking to hammer out details on a number of broad pledges recently made by the Chinese leadership: more Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and services; increased U.S. access to China’s markets; better protection of U.S. intellectual property and reductions in Beijing’s subsidies to Chinese companies.

> Mr. Trump is correct about China’s economy, which by several measures appears to be hobbled by American tariffs on \$250 billion worth of Chinese imports. But the president’s confidence about the domestic economy largely ignores what others see as looming threats, including damage from a protracted federal government shutdown, the waning effects of Mr. Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut and contagion from China’s pain to American companies, farmers and consumers, Friday’s data notwithstanding.

> The disruption at the mouth of the Mississippi is an acute result of the US-China trade war. After US President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing punched back with duties on US exports including most of its $20bn in agricultural commodity sales.

> Soyabean exports, worth $12bn in 2017, were hit hardest. The oilseed’s conquest of farm fields in the past 20 years has largely been down to US farmers gambling on China’s demand for protein to nourish pigs and chickens. Beijing raised tariffs on soyabeans by 25 percentage points in July, pricing the US crop out of the world’s largest market and making it a symbol of deteriorating bilateral relations.
