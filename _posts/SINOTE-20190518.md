[US-China trade war: who will blink first?](https://www.ft.com/content/7c96e4a0-7886-11e9-bbad-7c18c0ea0201) <br> *by Sam Fleming, James Politi & Tom Mitchell, from ft.com, 20190517*

> On Thursday morning, as Walmart delivered a stark warning that Donald Trump’s [widening trade war with China](https://www.ft.com/us-china-trade-dispute) would lead to higher prices for American consumers, John Flynn stood in front of one of the US retailer’s stores in Virginia defiantly defending the US president.
>
> “I think he’s doing the right thing, America is becoming very dependent on stuff from China,” said Mr Flynn, a 55-year-old real estate agent who grew up in the steel country of western Pennsylvania. “If prices go up, prices go up. It’s going to hurt them [the Chinese] in the long run too. So it’s just a matter of who blinks first,” he said, as he stepped into his Honda Accord.

> Mr Flynn’s words from the parking lot in Manassas — near the site of the first major land battle of the American civil war — will give Mr Trump comfort that he can prevail in the biggest economic gamble of his presidency.

[As Trade War Rages, China’s Sway Over the U.S. Fades](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/business/china-trade-influence.html) <br> *by Keith Bradsher, from nytimes.com, 20190517*

> China usually gets its way. In Washington, on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms, Beijing has used the country’s size and promise for decades to quell opposition and reward those who helped its rise.

> Those days may be coming to an end.

> As it struggles with President Trump’s trade war, a maturing and debt-laden China is discovering that it no longer has the same pull. Members of both political parties in the United States favor a tougher stance against Beijing. Some old business allies are standing on the sidelines or even cheering the Trump administration’s strong stands.
>
> China could still prevail on the trade war’s major issues. But the conflict’s length and severity reflect the growing perception that the country no longer holds the promise that once enthralled politicians and businesses in the United States.

> Just how bad are things between the United States and China? Over an evening beer in Beijing this week, a friend and I debated which prominent American company China would whack first. It’s a serious question—and the answer could be the next ugly step in the escalating economic dispute between the two powers.

> The intrusive Chinese state has all sorts of levers to control the economy and society, and in an environment that lacks rule of law, officials can pull them at their pleasure. They also have far more targets to aim at than the trade data suggest. Many American companies have substantial operations within China that are tremendously important to their bottom lines. General Motors and its partners, for instance, [sold](https://investor.gm.com/node/19046/html) more than 3.6 million vehicles in China last year, almost all of them manufactured locally. Starbucks [operates](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922418000052/sbux-9302018x10xk.htm) more coffee shops in China than in any other market aside from the United States. These businesses are vulnerable to government-inspired nefariousness, from product boycotts and state-press smear campaigns to regulatory investigations.

[Grindr and the 'new cold war': why US concerns over the app are dangerous](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/18/grindr-us-security-china-new-cold-war) <br> *by Moira Weigel, from theguardian.com, 20190518*

> How did a hookup app become a matter of national security interest? The CFIUS investigation, which was first reported in late March, evidently focused on the array of sensitive data Grindr collects about its users: location, sexual preferences, [HIV status](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/inside-grindr-fears-china-wanted-access-user-data-hiv-research-n989996)and explicit photographs that are exchanged while chatting. Even though [Beijing Kunlun](https://theconversation.com/should-grindr-users-worry-about-what-china-will-do-with-their-data-95972) is a private company, the Chinese government can easily require it to turn over such data. On principle, the US government may want to protect its citizens from prying eyes. But they are particularly concerned about a subset of users: the [Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-orders-chinese-company-to-sell-grindr-app-11553717942) that because a large number of military personnel or other US government employees may use Grindr, Trump administration officials believe the Chinese government could obtain Grindr user data to blackmail individuals who hold top-secret security clearances or decision-making power over issues pertaining to China’s interests.
>
> The case of Grindr might seem like a one-off oddity. On the contrary, it demonstrates how two of the biggest stories of our moment are colliding: the rise of the data economy, which sacrifices privacy to profits, and the escalation of US-China tensions, which pundits and politicians are already calling a [new cold war.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/state-department-preparing-for-clash-of-civilizations-with-china) It also reveals the profound problems with that framework.
