## Sharp power

[Michael Kovrig’s detention has ushered in a disturbing new reality for diplomats working in China](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-michael-kovrigs-detention-has-ushered-in-a-disturbing-new-reality-for/) <br> *by David Mulroney, from theglobeandmail.com, 20190116* <br> The author was Canada’s ambassador to China from 2009 to 2012.

> It is normal for diplomats to return to China later in life to do research, attend conferences or pursue business interests. Now, they must worry that some visit or conversation that was a legitimate part of their diplomatic work years earlier will make them vulnerable to the kind of retaliatory detention that appears to be China’s diplomatic weapon of choice. This may persuade diplomats, or the people who deploy them, that it is safer to do their work remotely, drastically cutting back travel and reducing their contacts with the Chinese people.
>
> That would be a tremendous loss, because diplomacy is ultimately about trying to understand and communicate with real people. And just as it is important for foreigners to understand China, China has a huge stake in being better understood. Understanding is not agreement, but it reduces the prospect that relations will be entirely governed by suspicion, and creates space for sympathy and respect. Experienced, professional observers such as Mr. Kovrig make us aware of the enormous challenges China faces, and of many local-level innovations and reforms that are otherwise invisible to the wider world.

[Schellenberg Death Sentence: Canadian's Verdict Will Backfire on Beijing](https://www.hudson.org/research/14771-schellenberg-death-sentence-canadian-s-verdict-will-backfire-on-beijing) <br> *by John Lee, from hudson.org, 20190116*

> Schellenberg’s plight will backfire on Beijing, however. On the defensive over many issues, China needs to win more hearts and minds. Instead, the ruling will only push away friendly countries and stiffen the unity and resolve of those voicing deep concerns with Chinese actions.
>
> China is a growing but lonely rising power and is widely distrusted. It has few enduring allies and supporters. It could be bad faith or bad timing. But sentencing a Canadian to death has only raised collective suspicion and deepened its isolation.

[Germany’s China Problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/germanys-china-problem.html?partner=rss&emc=rss) <br> *by Anna Sauerbrey, from nytimes.com, 20190117*

> When it comes to China, Germany has to walk a very thin line in a rapidly changing international environment. The trans-Atlantic relationship has been rattled since Donald Trump took office; Germany suddenly finds itself agreeing with China more on certain issues, like climate change, than with the United States, its longtime ally.
>
> As a consequence, German diplomats have to play a tricky game: Partnering with an ideological adversary against its close ally on some issues, while sticking with that suddenly difficult ally against its most important trading partner on others. And in both cases, it has to stand by its commitment to the rules-based international order when neither of those partners holds the same level of commitment, at least at the moment.

## Xinjiang

> How did the PRC come to this? I see two broad reasons: an official CCP misunderstanding of what Islam means to most Uighurs and other Muslim groups, and a recent CCP embrace of Han-centric ethnic assimilationism, an idea that runs counter to traditional Chinese modes of pluralism. (The Han are the majority ethnic group in the PRC as a whole, though not in the former colonial territories of Xinjiang and Tibet.)

> There are grave dangers to locking up a million people for coercive indoctrination at the hands of hastily mustered, ill-trained guards. Even if the Xinjiang reeducation gulag avoids the widespread torture, rape, and killing that have accompanied ethnic cleansing elsewhere, and Uighurs and other Turkic peoples can endure the psychological trauma of the camps, it is a tragedy for the PRC to abandon Chinese traditions for managing diversity in favor of the Western ideology of nationalism, so ill-fitted to the globalizing age the CCP wants to help shape...

[History shows the folly of China’s paranoia about Islam](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/01/19/history-shows-the-folly-of-chinas-paranoia-about-islam?fsrc=rss) <br> *from economist.com, 20190117*

> If it is a shame that Bai Chongxi is largely forgotten, it is heartbreaking to find how defensively he is remembered in places that know his name. Bai’s kinsfolk still live in villages near Guilin city. Chaguan found some of them preparing ducks for curing ahead of Chinese new year. Alas, even mild questions about whether their ancestor protected the Hui caused disquiet. “Just stop talking,” hissed a woman to an old man surnamed Bai, who had begun answering as he salted duck neck-bones. “We are very happy and there is no ethnic discrimination,” said the woman.

> Such a historically ignorant vision of Chinese Islam would appal Bai Chongxi, as would official attacks on halal rules. The general was a pragmatist. During wartime rows about dietary codes he proposed creating Hui units with their own food so they could get on with fighting. Communist bosses seem not to care for such approaches. They prefer sullen submission to shared loyalties.

> In a small, central Beijing courtyard, family and friends are gathering to pay tribute to Zhao Ziyang - the most powerful man in China to oppose the decision to send tanks into Tiananmen Square nearly 30 years ago.
>
> He was subsequently erased from Chinese history for what party officials deemed his "serious mistakes" that day.
>
> ...
>
> China's Communist Party has spent nearly 30 years trying to erase the events of 4 June 1989 from history and young people here have little knowledge or understanding of what happened that day. The story of Zhao Ziyang is proof those efforts still continue: the man who was the highest ranking Party official in the country at the time of those momentous events is now expunged from the record and, even in death, still regarded as a threat.
>
> Every year, the family says, the number of people who come to pay their respects diminishes slightly. Some are stopped from entering when they arrive or - as Zhao Ziyang was for 16 years - prevented from travelling around the city.
