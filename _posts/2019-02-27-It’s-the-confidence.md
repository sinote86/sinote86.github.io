## Slowdown

> With its housing and industrial sectors mired by overcapacity, greater production of consumer goods and services should provide a more sustainable basis for economic growth in China.

> But with investment in new production the cornerstone of the country’s development, economists expect a more consumption-driven economy to be a slower growing one. Indeed, the shift has coincided with a slowdown in Chinese growth, which last year fell to its lowest rate, 6.6 per cent, since 1990.
>
> Beijing faces a tricky rebalancing act, therefore, as it tries to avoid a “hard landing” for the economy: investment remains critical to growth and slowing it too rapidly could deflate consumption. But if consumption remains at its current level — still low by international standards — then wasted investment and lack of demand will drag down the economy anyway.

> We talked to 20 people including sales managers, government officials and more than a dozen other professional workers to ask them how much the gloomy outlook has damped their optimism. The answer in most cases — it hasn’t.
>
> From a steel town in the northwestern province of Gansu to the foreign trade hub of Guangdong province in the south, most of the people interviewed said they felt the same or more optimistic than a year ago, even before the recent stock market rally. Almost a third rated their prospects five out of five for the year ahead.
>
> But when questioned about their spending plans, job prospects and family aspirations, a more complex picture emerges, one where cracks begin to appear and caution has become the byword — a lawyer who’s doing well because of a rise in property disputes, a teacher who worries her students may struggle to find work, an auto company employee who switched to selling life insurance to an aging population.

[Beijing rhetoric belies reality of China’s private enterprise](https://www.ft.com/content/82914816-3969-11e9-b856-5404d3811663) <br> *by Henny Sender, from ft.com, 20190227*

> To listen to China’s government, you would think it was relaxed about private business founders. The Communist party has in recent years issued a stream of reassurances on their property rights, with messaging from officials as senior as Premier Li Keqiang underlining the importance of such protections to continued economic growth.
>
> But the country’s entrepreneurs have never felt more threatened. After decades of economic liberalisation that fuelled the rise of the private sector, Chinese politics and economics have swung dramatically back to a more interventionist model. It is again the party, rather than the market, that allocates resources and dictates what not long ago was left to companies to decide.

[China Isn’t Having Enough Babies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/opinion/china-isnt-having-enough-babies.html) <br> *by Wang Feng & Yong Cai, from nytimes.com, 20190226*

> Fewer babies were born in China last year than in 2017, and already fewer had been born in 2017 than in 2016. There were 15.23 million new births in 2018, down by more than 11 percent from the year before. The authorities had predicted that easing and then abolishing the one-child policy in the mid-2010s would trigger a baby boom; it’s been more like a baby bust.
>
> No, these figures don’t mean that China’s population itself has started to decline. But they do mean that the population overall is aging, and fast. And they mean that the Chinese government can no longer manipulate fertility with blunt pro-natal policies; the reasons for the drop run too deep. Instead of futile, retrograde statist intervention in people’s reproductive choices, the authorities should undertake broad economic and social reforms to address the deep causes of the decline while mitigating the burdens of its worst effects.

> As a sub-zero blizzard raged outside, Ronghui Chen pushed open a glass window to let in a gust of cold air.
>
> He was in Yichun, a faded boomtown in northeastern China, where in December, 2016 he began photographing young people whose isolation he recognized in his own life. “This kind of heating puts people into the most lethargic state, depriving them of the ability to reflect,” he later said in a phone interview. At the same time, he also finds it frightening to become emotionally hardened like ice underfoot in the northeastern regions that made up China’s Rust Belt. “I feel that many people, like the land itself, are making themselves freeze.”
>
> Over three successive winters, he worked on “Freezing Lands,” a collection of large-format photographs that explores contrasts. The cold conveyed the desolation of towns and cities whose populations are shrinking as people leave the region for education and work in bustling cities, just as Mr. Chen had done himself. The young residents spent their winters in warm and brightly painted interiors, uncertain about the future.
