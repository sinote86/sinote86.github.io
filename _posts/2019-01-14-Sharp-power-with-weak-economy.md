## Death sentence

[Chinese Court Sentences Canadian National to Death for Drug Crimes in Retrial](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-court-sentences-canadian-national-to-death-for-drug-crimes-in-retrial-11547470636) <br> *by Eva Dou & Paul Vieira, from wsj.com, 20190114*

> A Chinese court ordered the death penalty for a Canadian national in the latest example of how deeply ensnared Canada has become in a battle between the U.S. and Beijing over the detention of a prominent Huawei Technologies Co. executive.
>
> ...
>
> “We are a bit like the meat in a sandwich right now,” said Peter MacKay, Canada’s former foreign minister and now a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie. He added his main concern is Chinese officials using the detention and sentencing of Canadian citizens to warn other nations about aligning with the U.S. in its cold-war approach against Beijing. “They wouldn’t dream of doing this [to] the U.S.,” he said.
>
> ...
>
> In Ottawa on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the death sentence was of extreme concern to the government, “as it should be to all our international friends and allies that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply [the] death penalty as in this case facing a Canadian.”

[China executes thousands of people every year. But the exact number is a state secret.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/14/china-executes-thousands-people-every-year-exact-number-is-state-secret/) <br> *by Adam Taylor, from washingtonpost.com, 20190114*

> But while Schellenberg’s case may be unique, executions for seemingly lower-level crime such as drug smuggling are certainly not. According to Amnesty’s 2017 report, China was among the small number of countries known to have executed people for drug-related crimes that year, alongside Iran, Saudi Arabia and Singapore.
>
> Many foreigners have been executed for alleged drug offenses. In 2009, China executed a British businessman on allegations of smuggling heroin, despite the personal intervention of British diplomats and Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who claimed that Akmal Shaikh’s mental health had been overlooked. In 2017, a Colombian man was executed for drug smuggling.

> The Chinese system is not known for its consistency or openness. A [2008 Washington Post investigation](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/23/AR2008122302795.html) found that capital punishment was marked by “secrecy, lack of due process and uneven application of the law,” despite attempts at reform.

## Slowdown

> China reported a sharp drop in exports for December, sending stock markets across Asia lower, as a global slowdown and a punishing trade war with the US hit the world’s second-largest economy. 
>
> The 4.4 per cent fall in December exports came as China reported an annual trade surplus with the US of $323bn, the highest since at least 2006, according to Reuters data, as exporters rushed to ship orders ahead of a threat of rising tariffs.

> In a sign of belated impact from the trade war, monthly exports to the US fell 3.5 per cent in December, while imports of US goods plummeted 36 per cent as China largely stopped buying American soyabeans and other commodities.
>
> Analysts said slower global growth was to blame for the sluggish December trade figures. Exports to other markets, including Japan and the EU, also shrunk while shipments to Hong Kong, a centre for re-exports of Chinese goods, fell 26 per cent.

> Chinese investment in the United States and Europe dropped sharply in 2018 after a couple of gangbuster years as Beijing seeks to control flows of capital and advanced economies grow warier of China’s economic influence.

> Amid a trade war between the Washington and Beijing, reforms to American investment regulations aimed at stopping the outflow of critical U.S. technologies, and a slowing Chinese economy, investors in Beijing and multinational firms are examining deals in European and U.S. companies with greater skepticism.

> China’s leaders have already begun to stimulate the economy but there are serious doubts that the old formula of state-backed credit growth, infrastructure investment and speculative asset bubbles can juice up another growth cycle. The best remedy for China’s economic woes is bold and rapid reform of the kind that saw large swaths of the stultified state-owned sector carved up and overhauled in the late 1990s.
>
> The prospects for real reform of this kind are improved by two factors. The first is the current slowdown itself. Reforms during good times are difficult to enact but introduce a sense of crisis and big things can happen. Second is the trade war with America. The demands of an external force are often a useful tool in pushing change, as China’s leaders found when they used requirements for entry to the World Trade Organization in 2001 as impetus to drive through difficult domestic reforms. China has reached a crucial moment in its economic history. The difference this time is that its success or failure matters more to the rest of the world than at any time in centuries.
