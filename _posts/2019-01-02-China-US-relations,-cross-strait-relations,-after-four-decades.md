## China-US

[As China Talks Begin, Trump’s Trade Negotiator Tries to Keep President From Wavering](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/us/politics/robert-lighthizer-president-trump.html) <br> *by Glenn Thrush, from nytimes.com, 20190101*

> Mr. Lighthizer — whose top deputy will meet with Chinese officials this week ahead of more high-level talks in February — has played down any differences with Mr. Trump and views his role as ultimately executing the directive of his boss. But the trade representative, who declined to be interviewed, has told friends and associates that he is intent on preventing the president from being talked into accepting “empty promises” like temporary increases in soybean or beef purchases.
>
> Mr. Lighthizer, 71, is pushing for substantive changes, such as forcing China to end its practice of requiring American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition of doing business there. But after 40 years of dealing with China and watching it dangle promises that do not materialize, Mr. Lighthizer remains deeply skeptical of Beijing and has warned Mr. Trump that the United States may need to exert more pressure through additional tariffs in order to win true concessions.

[How Trump Can Challenge China](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/trump-china/579202/) <br> *by Reihan Salam, from theatlantic.com, 20190101* <br> The author is a contributing editor at *The Atlantic* and executive editor of *National Review*.

> The surest way to ease tensions between China and the United States over the long run is therefore to allow low- and middle-income Chinese workers to keep more of what they earn. Though this wouldn’t guarantee a lower bilateral trade deficit, boosting Chinese household consumption would almost certainly boost China’s consumption of imports, including U.S. imports. The interests of Chinese workers and U.S. workers aren’t at odds. They are perfectly aligned. It is the Chinese party-state that profits from the suppression of household consumption, and that channels vast resources to party members and politically connected industrialists, not the Chinese people.
>
> That is the vulnerability that Trump can now exploit. Imagine if the president gave one major public address to that effect, ideally on Chinese soil. And if this all sounds too out of character for a man who has shown little appetite for such moralistic crusading, substitute one of the many Democrats looking to make a mark in the race for the party’s presidential nomination. 

[Why the World Needs America and China to Get Along](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/opinion/america-china-climate-change-nuclear-weapons.html) <br> *by Robert E. Rubin, from nytimes.com, 20190102* <br> The author was secretary of the Treasury from 1995 to 1999 and is co-chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations.

> Leaders in both countries should recognize our imperative self-interest in working together on hugely consequential transnational issues, especially two threats to life on earth as we know it: nuclear weapons and climate change.
>
> No single country can tackle these threats alone, and existing international institutions have proved inadequate. The best chance for successfully dealing with these overarching issues — as well as other transnational issues like disease pandemics, terrorism and cybersecurity — is for the world’s two largest national economies to catalyze global action.

> So much is riding on the future of US-China ties that this year could decide whether a new “economic iron curtain”, as former US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson has called it, falls across the world. If such a fundamental division starts to bed down, the decoupling that defines the US-China relationship could spread to America’s allies.
>
> ...
>
> Therein lies the potential for a brighter future for China’s economy and its relations with the US. Mr Xi should re-emphasise a genuine rule of law, the primacy of market forces over administrative fiat and demonstrate that private enterprises are just as prized as their state-owned cousins.
>
> If Beijing does this, it could lead to more constructive engagement with the US. Washington, for its part, should recognise as a priority that China is an essential economic partner. It should dial back the rhetoric, define its core interests and its red lines, freeing up some commerce for normal relations. Returning to full engagement may not be possible, but this should not preclude a partial relationship.

## Taiwan

[China's Xi threatens Taiwan with force but also seeks peaceful 'reunification'](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan/chinas-xi-threatens-taiwan-with-force-but-also-seeks-peaceful-reunification-idUSKCN1OW04K) <br> *from reuters.com, 20190102* <br> Reporting by Ben Blanchard and Yimou Lee; Writing by Michael Martina; Editing by Paul Tait and Nick Macfie

>
> Xi spoke at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on the 40th anniversary of a landmark Taiwan policy statement.
>
> He said “reunification” must come under a one-China principle that accepts Taiwan as part of China, anathema to supporters of Taiwan independence, adding that the “one country, two systems” model of autonomy, with which China governs Hong Kong, was the best way for Taiwan.
>
> China translates the word “*tong yi*” as “reunification”, but it can also be translated as “unification”, a term in English preferred by supporters of Taiwan independence who point out the Communist government has never ruled Taiwan and so it cannot be “reunified”.

> “Differences in systems aren’t an obstacle to unification, much less an excuse for separatism,” Mr. Xi said in nationally televised remarks before an audience of government and military officials in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. He said unification between China and Taiwan is inevitable and that while Beijing prefers peaceful means for achieving that goal, military measures remain an option.
>
> His remarks were seen as a direct response to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who said Tuesday in her New Year’s Day address that the island’s people want to preserve their own political system. Hours after the Chinese leader’s Wednesday speech, Ms. Tsai rejected his offer, saying Taiwanese voters won’t go for the proposal, known as “one country, two systems.” The framework would place the island under China’s rule with limited autonomy, as has been done in Hong Kong.

> Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong has enjoyed legal autonomy since it returned to Chinese sovereignty, and residents of the city still have much wider freedoms than citizens in the rest of China. But publishing, news media and pro-democratic activism in Hong Kong have retreated in recent years, reflecting the growing weight of Chinese political pressures.
>
> ...
>
> Mr. Xi portrayed Taiwanese as generally favoring unification with China. But only 3 percent of Taiwanese respondents in a survey published last August by National Chengchi University said they wanted unification now. An additional 12.5 percent said they preferred the status quo and eventual reunification.
>
> But in his speech, Mr. Xi signaled that he would be willing to play a long-term game in an effort to gain acceptance, if not support, in Taiwan for China’s political goals.

## Slowdown

[China manufacturing sector contracts as economic slowdown worsens](https://www.ft.com/content/6880779c-0e46-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745) <br> *by Gabriel Wildau, from ft.com, 20190102*

> China’s privately owned manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in 19 months in December, the latest sign of how weakening domestic demand and US tariffs are pressuring the world’s second-largest economy. 
>
> ...
>
> In China, recent economic data have pointed to strong downward pressures. Profits at industrial companies fell in November for the first time in nearly three years, official data showed last week. Retail sales, a closely watched indicator of consumption, grew at their slowest pace in 15 years in November.

> The flood of money rushing into Chinese internet startups has slowed, dashing hopes of quick windfalls for many investors.
>
> Just six months ago, investors from the U.S. to Hong Kong were pouring cash into internet companies in China that were raising funds privately or going public, sending valuations soaring. Then, a sharp turn in markets during the summer hammered the share prices of many newly listed tech companies, sending a chill through the sector. Large investors say there is still money to be made in the sector, but they are more selective about what to invest in.

[Apple Makes Rare Cut to Sales Guidance](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revises-guidance-sees-lower-revenue-in-fiscal-1st-quarter-11546465050) <br> *by Robert McMillan & Tripp Mickle, from wsj.com, 20190102*

> While Mr. Cook pointed to China’s economic turmoil for the revenue shortfall in the quarter ended Dec. 29, Apple’s share of the Chinese smartphone market has been shrinking, crowded out by tech giants such as China’s Huawei Technologies Co. that market increasingly sophisticated phones at a lower price tag.
>
> ...
>
> Analysts have also been closely watching China’s economy for signs that increasing Chinese nationalism, combined with higher-quality China-made products, is moving consumers to purchase local brands...
>
> Mr. Cook said Apple anticipated challenges in key emerging markets, but didn’t expect the magnitude of the economic deceleration, especially in greater China. A contraction in the smartphone market in the region was particularly sharp, he said.
>
> “As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,” he wrote in the letter.

## Crackdown

[Censoring China’s Internet, for Stability and Profit](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/business/china-internet-censor.html) <br> *by Li Yuan, from nytimes.com, 20190102*

> For Chinese companies, staying on the safe side of government censors is a matter of life and death. Adding to the burden, the authorities demand that companies censor themselves, spurring them to hire thousands of people to police content.
>
> That in turn has created a growing and lucrative new industry: censorship factories.
>
> ...
>
> Workers are briefed at the beginning of their shift on the newest censoring instructions sent by clients, which the clients themselves receive from government censors. Workers then must answer about 10 questions designed to test their memory. The results of the exam affect the workers’ pay.
>
> ...
>
> Workers like Mr. Li make \$350 to $500 a month, about average pay in Chengdu. Each worker is expected to review 1,000 to 2,000 articles during a shift. Articles uploaded to the news app must be approved or rejected within an hour...

[China’s Gulag for Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/opinion/uighur-muslims-china-gulag.html) <br> *by Mustafa Akyol, from nytimes.com, 20190102* <br> The author is a senior fellow on Islam and modernity at the Cato Institute and the author, most recently, of “*The Islamic Jesus.*”

> Why are Muslim leaders, especially those who love to be the champions of oppressed Muslims, so lenient toward China? There are three answers. 
>
> 1. One is that coziness with China, the world’s second-largest economic power, pays... Moreover, China does not shy away from offering its economic assistance as hush money. 
> 2. A second reason for Muslim silence is that the Chinese government crackdown on Uighurs is based on a premise that law and order can be restored by eradicating enemies of the government and traitors within a society. This is authoritarian language that most Muslim leaders understand well. It is their own language.
> 3. The third reason is that most Muslims who are likely to feel solidarity with their oppressed coreligionists think of the oppressors as “the West,” defined as the capitalist, hedonist, Zionist civilization led by the Great Satan...
>
> For Muslim autocrats and Islamists, a Confucian-Islamic alliance may still be alluring. China can look like a great model, in which the economy grows without Western nuisances like human rights, free speech or limited government. For Muslim societies, however, the Uighur crisis must be a wake-up call. It shows what can happen to Muslims when authoritarian governments embrace Islamophobia as state policy.

[Short Cuts](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n01/billy-beswick/short-cuts) <br> *by Billy Beswick, from lrb.co.uk, 20190103*

> As well as canteen staff, the PKU Marxists have supported the construction workers who staged a protest in 2015 to demand unpaid wages. But as they noted, it isn’t only university staff who have to deal with unfair labour conditions: ‘If the situation is like this even within the walls of a university, how ruthless must the outside world appear when its mask of compassion and harmony is removed.’
>
> ...
>
> There is the potential here for a very broad alliance, composed of workers, students, intellectuals and disillusioned party members. This, along with the destabilising effects of a widespread migrant workers’ movement, is enough to make the CCP nervous. It has reacted in exactly the way one would expect – with blunt force – but I suspect it is particularly afraid of vocal Marxist resistance. Posters proclaiming the nation’s commitment to socialist values are everywhere; commemorating Marx’s bicentenary last year, Xi Jinping said that ‘Marx’s theories still twinkle with the dazzling light of truth!’ Marxist critiques are unsettling because they point to the inequities in Chinese society, while remaining within the state’s ideological framework.
