> While markets globally would welcome a cessation of trade hostilities, a partial deal could open Mr. Trump to criticism from both his conservative supporters and U.S. business groups that he has settled for too little and failed to push for the fundamental reform in Chinese industrial and technology policies that his administration has said are at the heart of the dispute.
>
> In the talks this week, Chinese and U.S. negotiators are focusing on producing a broad outline of a trade agreement for their presidents to clinch at a possible summit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

> A top priority for Mr. Lighthizer and Mr. Mnuchin, according to several people with detailed knowledge of the negotiations, is to ensure that any deal they strike has teeth if Beijing does not live up to its obligations.
>
> American negotiators want to create a mechanism that would automatically raise tariffs on Chinese goods if its exports to the United States keep rising, said three of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.
>
> Even a temporary deal that simply papers over the two countries’ differences could benefit both the Chinese government, which is contending with slowing economic growth, and Mr. Trump, who wants to be able to declare a victory after a string of political defeats. But the talks face big obstacles, including how to enforce China’s earlier promises and whether Chinese officials will make further pledges on issues like protecting intellectual property, halting forced transfers of American technology and limiting government subsidies to exporters.

> As Beijing’s trade showdown with Washington approaches its climax in this sensitive anniversary year, it is likely, despite the economic clouds gathering, that Mr Xi will be even more determined than usual to hold his ground.

> To compete with a more assertive China, the United States should invest in alliances and multilateral institutions, which President Trump and his administration have rejected or undermined, a [report](https://asiasociety.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/CourseCorrection_FINAL_2.7.19_1.pdf) issued Tuesday by prominent scholars and former top White House, State Department and trade officials working on China concluded.
>
> In addition, the Trump administration should take firm stands against China on its malign policies, from mercantilist measures to military expansionism, but should avoid overreacting to hard-line actions by President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party while searching for areas of cooperation with Beijing, the report said.

## Obituary

[Roderick MacFarquhar, Eminent China Scholar, Dies at 88](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/obituaries/roderick-macfarquhar-dead.html) <br> *by Jane Perlez, from nytimes.com, 20190212*

> Professor MacFarquhar specialized in the origins of the Cultural Revolution, the decade of turmoil that terrorized China beginning in 1966. His three-volume work, “The Origins of the Cultural Revolution,” came to be considered a classic.
>
> The research for those books, which were based on dense official texts, public speeches and Mao’s own words, opened a world hidden to the West and illuminated an era of China’s past that still seems almost unfathomable.

> Professor MacFarquhar had in the last several years turned to writing a book on India. But he was always asked about China and its future. One thing seemed certain, he said: The Communist Party will not last forever.
>
> “I do foresee the Communist Party fading,” he said in the 2017 interview. “How it will happen I’ve not got the slightest idea. The idea that the party knows best, and only the party can rule, I think it will disappear. Whether it will disappear by some kind of new revolution or just gradually fade away, I don’t know.”
