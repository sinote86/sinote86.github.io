>
> China’s commerce ministry said on Friday that Jeffrey Gerrish, the US deputy trade representative, would meet officials in Beijing.

> China stepped up efforts to boost lending in its flagging economy, with the central bank freeing up new funds and the country’s premier ordering big banks to lend to cash-starved small businesses.
>
> Friday’s moves by the central bank and Premier Li Keqiang, though modest in scope, aim to bolster a weak link in the economy: smaller businesses that traditionally have trouble getting bank credit and whose continued troubles threaten to hamper a turnaround.

> A decade ago, China played a vital role in rescuing the world economy from the financial crisis by launching an unprecedented Rmb4tn stimulus programme. Today, the fear in markets is the opposite. Already unnerved about rising rates in the US and slowing growth in Europe, many investors now worry that China could lead the global economy into the next recession.

> Still, global investors are wondering whether the government will now support the economy with a more forceful stimulus. A cabinet meeting in late July marked a decisive break with austerity, as policymakers called for new stimulus measures and cited “uncertainties in the external environment” — an oblique reference to rising trade tensions.

> The government’s light-touch approach to stimulus partly reflects the reduced policy flexibility today compared with 2008, when debt levels were lower and a simpler growth model based on investment in housing and infrastructure had more room to run.

> Ms. Zhou’s essay about the experience, which she posted online in July, was an impassioned plea for women’s rights in China — and a daring rebuke of the status quo.
>
> “It’s important for every girl to speak up and say what she has suffered,” she wrote in the essay, which totaled more than 3,000 Chinese characters. “We need to make sure society knows that these massacres exist.”
>
> ...
>
> Ms. Zhou has helped abused women seek justice, accompanying them to police stations to file criminal reports. She has criticized the government and society at large for not doing more to protect women against domestic violence. And she has meticulously chronicled her legal battle, publishing a diary about her triumphs and setbacks.
>
> Ms. Zhou acknowledges that women in China face many obstacles, including vaguely defined laws on rape and harassment and a culture that often blames women, not men, in cases of sexual abuse. But she says she is optimistic that attitudes will change.
