[‘If I disappear’: Chinese students make farewell messages amid crackdowns over labor activism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/if-i-disappear-chinese-students-make-farewell-messages-amid-crackdowns-over-labor-activism-/2019/05/25/6fc949c0-727d-11e9-9331-30bc5836f48e_story.html) <br> *by Gerry Shih, from washingtonpost.com, 20190525*

> Over the past eight months, China’s ruling party has gone to extraordinary lengths to shut down the small club of students at the country’s top university. Peking University’s young Marxists drew the government’s ire after they campaigned for workers’ rights and openly criticized social inequality and corruption in China.
>
> That alone was provocative. In recent years, China’s leaders have been highly sensitive to rumblings of labor unrest as the sputtering economy lays bare the divides between rich and poor — fissures that were formed, and mostly overlooked, during decades of white-hot growth.
>
> But the source of the dissent carried an extra sting for the government. Peking University, after all, educates China’s best and brightest, the top 0.1 percent of the country’s high school graduates. And its rebellious young Marxists were doing something particularly embarrassing: They were standing up for disenfranchised workers against the state.
>
> They were, in other words, emulating the early Communist Party itself.

[How Berlin Became an Unlikely Home for China’s Artists](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/why-chinas-expat-artists-move-berlin/589951/) <br> *by Melissa Chan, from theatlantic.com, 20190525*

> Since taking power in 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has tightened the Communist Party’s grip on all aspects of life and society, [including the arts](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/censorship-could-stifle-chinese-market). He believes that art should serve a [nationalist](https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/10/15/a-year-after-xis-landmark-speech-on-the-arts-some-things-get-left-out/) purpose, that nudity is bad, and that contemporary art and architecture [are ](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1915125/no-more-weird-architecture-chinese-directive-draws-line)[“weird.”](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1915125/no-more-weird-architecture-chinese-directive-draws-line) Under his leadership, the censorship-review process all creatives must submit their works to, whether for an art exhibition or a film’s release, has become even more conservative and unpredictable. That has not just had a chilling effect on the country’s artistic community, but has encouraged many to pursue their passion overseas—Fan among them.
>
> Since moving here almost two years ago, Fan has been prolific, writing three scripts, directing two projects, and sitting on the jury for the queer-film prize at the Berlin Film Festival. He’s far from alone, though. I moved here at about the same time as Fan and have come across an array of Chinese artists and writers, performers and filmmakers—all up to no good by the standards of Beijing’s morality police, hungrily taking in the many crazy, dissolute subcultures Berlin has to offer. The city’s affordable housing, the country’s special visa for freelancers and artists, and German-government support for a few of China’s best-known creatives have meant that some of the most interesting developments in modern Chinese culture are happening as much in Berlin as in Beijing.

[Huawei Ban Threatens Wireless Service in Rural Areas](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/technology/huawei-rural-wireless-service.html) <br> *by Cecilia Kang, from nytimes.com, 20190525*

> The Trump administration’s ban, [its latest move](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html?module=inline) against the company, rippled through the telecommunications industry. Wireless carriers in several countries, including Britain and Japan, said they would no longer sell the company’s phones. Google said it would stop providing its Android operating software in new Huawei smartphones, which are popular in Europe and Asia.
>
> But perhaps nowhere will the changes be felt more acutely than in rural America, where wireless service is spotty despite yearslong government efforts to improve coverage. They also add to the economic uncertainty created by the White House’s trade war with China. Farmers are fearful of an extended hit to their exports.
>
> Huawei is essential for many wireless carriers that serve sprawling, sparsely populated regions because its gear for transmitting cell signals often costs far less than other options.

[Huawei’s European Customers Are Put on Hold by U.S. Ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/business/huawei-us-china-europe-.html) <br> *by Amie Tsang & Adam Satariano, from nytimes.com, 20190524*

> Europe has been one of Huawei’s biggest success stories. Now it is on the front line of the trade and technology war between China and the United States.
>
> The move by Google this week to cut off Android support to phones made by Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, will hobble their European users and highlights how deeply the Continent relies on American and Chinese companies for gadgets, apps and internet services. 
>
> From its early days selling equipment to wireless carriers, Huawei has expanded at an extraordinary rate in Europe, capturing more than a quarter of the smartphone market. Google’s action is “potentially catastrophic” for Huawei’s hopes in Europe, said Ben Stanton, a senior analyst at Canalys, a research firm.

[Pain of Tariffs Tests Farmers’ Faith in Trump: ‘How Long Is Short-Term?’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/business/economy/farmers-trump-trade.html) <br> *by Patricia Cohen, from nytimes.com, 20190524*

> From the start, President Trump’s combative trade strategy toward China has carried the promise that short-term pain inflicted on farmers would be worth the longer-term gains for American producers, from agriculture to technology.
>
> As the trade war intensifies, faith in that proposition among the president’s most stalwart rural fans is being tested more than ever. 
>
> “How long is short-term?” Shane Goplin, a sixth-generation farmer growing soybeans and corn in west-central Wisconsin, wondered as he maneuvered his 16-row John Deere planter.
>
> China was the largest buyer of American soybeans until tit-for-tat tariffs all but halted the flow. And this month, souring prospects for a trade deal again sent prices tumbling. Mr. Trump responded on Thursday by announcing a [$16 billion package](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/farm-aid-package.html?module=inline) to help those hurt by the dispute. 
>
> The strategy may help shore up farmers’ support for Mr. Trump before the 2020 election, but it leaves them with a perplexing question: What does success ultimately look like?
