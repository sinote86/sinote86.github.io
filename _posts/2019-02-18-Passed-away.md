[‘Show Me That My Father Is Alive.’ China Faces Torrent of Online Pleas.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/world/asia/uighurs-china-internment-camps.html) <br>*by Austin Ramzy, from nytimes.com, 20190217*

> Many members of the Uighur ethnic group living in exile are worried that their relatives back home in China are locked up in internment camps — or dead.
>
> So when China released a video this past week to prove that a prominent Uighur musician had not died in custody as rumored, Uighurs around the world sat up.
>
> “Show me that my father is alive and well!” one [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adilemijit/status/1095413407505940480). “Where are my relatives?” [another asked](https://twitter.com/HATP21074362/status/1095372675101458435). In one clip, a child held up a photo of her missing father, weeping as she said: “[Show his video to us](https://twitter.com/HalmuratU/status/1095349841859960833).”

> China is closely tracking the locations of almost 2.6m people in its north-west region of Xinjiang, where Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are under a police lockdown, a data leak has revealed.
>
> A facial-recognition company and police contractor called SenseNets collected nearly 6.7m GPS co-ordinates in one database in a 24-hour period, according to security researcher Victor Gevers who found the database.
>
> This location data was matched to names — many of which were Uighur — as well as ID numbers, home addresses, photos, and employers, said Mr Gevers, who said he also discovered a large number of organisations were connecting to the database, including police stations, hotels, and various companies.

> "There's no way the US can crush us," he said. "The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit."

> However, he acknowledged that the potential loss of custom could have a significant impact.

[As China Talks Resume, Trump Seeks a Win on Trade](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-china-talks-resume-trump-seeks-a-win-on-trade-11550537816) <br> *by Jacob M. Schlesinger, from wsj.com, 20190218*

> Nor is China the only battle in the administration’s trade campaign. On Sunday, the president received a Commerce Department report laying out options for blocking auto imports in the name of national security—a measure that would largely affect U.S. allies in Europe, Japan and South Korea.
>
> ...
>
> Mr. Trump’s ability to tout completed trade pacts during his 2020 re-election campaign rests in part on how he steers his still-evolving trade strategy.
>
> One big question: whether he ultimately sees tariffs as a means to an end—a club to force open export markets—or an end in itself, to protect domestic industry from imports. He has at different times suggested different answers, and they can be contradictory goals.

[Why a US-China Trade Deal Is Not Enough](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-china-trade-deal-security-by-minxin-pei-2019-02) <br> *by Minxin Pei, from project-syndicate.org, 20190218*

> As Chinese and American trade negotiators meet in Washington to try to forge an accord on trade, observers are largely focused on the countries’ economic disagreements, such as over China’s subsidies to its state-owned enterprises. But to think that an agreement on trade will protect the world from a Sino-American cold war would be as premature as it would be naïve.
>
> ...
>
> But even if a comprehensive agreement is reached – either before March 1 or a few months from now – that unraveling will continue, albeit in a more gradual and less costly way. The reason – which many investors and corporate executives have failed to recognize – is that the trade war is not fundamentally about trade at all; rather, it is a manifestation of the escalating strategic competition between the two powers.

## Taiwan

[The Looming Taiwan Crisis](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/looming-taiwan-crisis-over-one-china-policy-by-richard-n--haass-2019-02) <br> *by Richard N. Haass, from project-syndicate.org, 20190215*

> A crisis over Taiwan in which the mainland introduced severe sanctions, imposed an embargo, or used military force could threaten the autonomy, safety, and economic wellbeing of the island and its 23 million people. For China, a crisis over Taiwan could wreck its relations with the US and many of its neighbors and rock an already shaky Chinese economy.
>
> For the US, a crisis could require coming to Taiwan’s aid, which could lead to a new Cold War or even a conflict with the mainland. A decision, though, to leave Taiwan to its own devices would undermine US credibility and possibly prompt Japan to reconsider its non-nuclear status and alliance with the US.
>
> In other words, the risks for all concerned are high. It would be best to avoid symbolic steps that would be unacceptable to the others. The *status quo* is admittedly imperfect, but it is far less imperfect than what would follow unilateral actions and attempts to resolve a situation that doesn’t lend itself to a neat solution.

> For decades, Chinese officials privately argued that with time and Chinese economic growth Taiwan would have no choice but to accept China’s embrace. Now Chinese analysts are far more pessimistic...
>
> ...
>
> Back in Washington, support for Taiwan is at its highest since the passing of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979. Former diplomat Richard C. Bush, now at the Brookings Institution, predicted that inviting Taiwan’s president to Congress would inflame Beijing. Others are less alarmed.
>
> Regardless, Taiwan, which has lain dormant for years as an issue between the United States and China, is back.

## Obituary 

[Li Rui, a Mao Confidant Who Turned Party Critic, Dies at 101](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/obituaries/li-rui-dead.html) <br> *by Ian Johnson, from nytimes.com, 20190215*

> Blunt, brash and quick-witted, Mr. Li’s experience epitomized the hopes and disappointments of a generation. His perseverance and longevity made him one of the most influential government critics in the seven-decade history of the People’s Republic of China. His work also helped reshape historians’ understanding of key moments in modern Chinese history — especially Mao’s responsibility for the catastrophic Great Leap Forward, in which famine killed more than 35 million people — while his political connections allowed him to protect moderate critics and make open appeals for free speech and constitutional government.
>
> But Mr. Li was no dissident. He died a Communist Party member, enjoying the privileges that came from having joined the party in 1937, earlier than almost anyone else alive in China. He had a large apartment, a generous pension and lavish benefits, such as top-flight medical care. The party imprisoned him, exiled him, and almost starved him to death, but even when it expelled him he eventually returned in hopes of effecting change from within.

>
> For the Chinese historian Zhang Lifan, Mr. Li epitomized the tragedy of a generation. Many initially saw the Communist Party as China’s salvation, watched as it turned into a dictatorial force under Mao’s nearly 30 years at the top, and then yearned that the reform era would finally bring changes — only to see these hopes dashed by the party’s inability to renounce authoritarianism.
>
> “The ‘China Through the Ages’ incident was a sign that Li Rui and his peers’ dream would never come true,” Mr. Zhang said. “But I understand Li Rui: To deny the party would have meant denying his own life.”

> Nanyang said she first spoke with her father about his wishes for his burial in 2008 and again last April at the time of his 100th birthday.
>
> “I asked him the exact same question: do you want to go to Babaoshan? Do you want a formal funeral and your body to be covered by the [Chinese Communist party] flag?’” she told the Guardian.
>
> “He paused a long long time, thinking, then he very clearly said: ‘I should go back to my hometown and be buried near my parents because I left home so early and never took care of my mother.’”
>
> Asked about a flag on his casket, Li said: “The red colour is a bad colour. You see it on TV. Now, everything is red, red, red.”
>
> Nanyang, who lives in the US, said she would not be attending the funeral in protest.
