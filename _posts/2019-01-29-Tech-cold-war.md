[America’s Cold War With Chinese Tech Turns Hot](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/huawei-and-the-battle-for-the-mobile-future/581512/) <br> *by Alexis C. Madrigal, from theatlantic.com, 20190129*

> The current Huawei saga has all the trappings of a Cold War espionage thriller, but reengineered for our current moment. Instead of Russia, it’s China. Instead of arms, it’s mobile technology. Instead of Iran, it’s … no, it’s still Iran, actually.
>
> Americans are generally unfamiliar with Huawei because the U.S. government has tried to keep the company out of the market. Around the world, however, Huawei and a few Western companies are vying to become the preferred backbone of the world’s wireless infrastructure. It’s a huge business, *and* it’s core to every country’s national security. American officials have long argued that, if push came to shove, Huawei would bend to the needs and desires of the Chinese government, not its customers in other countries.

[How China acquired mastery of vital microchip technology](https://www.ft.com/content/7cfb2f82-1ecc-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65) <br> *by Emily Feng, from ft.com, 20190129*

> There was little fanfare when the private Chinese company NavTech bought Silex Microsystems in 2015, acquiring the Swedish company’s mastery of manufacturing accelerometers, gyroscopes and other microscopic sensors.
>
> NavTech, which specialises in navigation technology for aviation, satellites and defence, announced shortly afterwards that it would build a $300m plant in Beijing “relying on Silex’s technology” in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), the components embedded in chips that are increasingly central to everything from mobile phones and medical devices to self-driving cars.
>
> But the acquisition of Silex, through a chain of investment holding companies, involved Chinese state-controlled funds. The new plant is located in a state-run industrial park, and has been backed by a state-run semiconductors fund, the Beijing Integrated Circuits fund.

[As China Trade Talks Begin, Trump Faces Pressure to Make a Deal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-china-trade-talks-begin-trump-faces-pressure-to-make-a-deal-11548808477) <br> *by Vivian Salama, from wsj.com, 20190129*

> Mr. Trump won the White House partly on a pledge to renegotiate trade deals with the aim of protecting American workers, a promise that had bipartisan appeal. If Mr. Trump’s optimistic projection proves correct, he stands to secure a big victory—one that his predecessors, despite criticizing China’s trade practices, were unable to achieve.

> But failure to reach a deal carries a risk not only for Mr. Trump, but for the Republican Party, said Mary Lovely, an economics professor at Syracuse University.
>
> “Republicans in Congress aren’t going to find additional tariffs really a winner back home, and they are already facing concern in large parts of the country over the impact of the partial government shutdown,” she said. “More tariffs and failure to get a deal will ultimately seem to people like further failure of the government.”

[With China, U.S. Needs to Verify But Trust](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-29/how-to-strike-a-winning-u-s-china-trade-deal) <br> *by Editorial Board, from bloomberg.com, 20190129*

> Of course, the U.S. may want to reserve the right to respond unilaterally to some instances of intellectual property theft — by barring offending Chinese companies from the American market or even cutting them off from the American banking system. To justify such tough actions, though, the U.S. would need to strengthen the U.S. Trade Representative’s ability to detect and document violations, while establishing a forum where U.S. companies could make their complaints without fear of retaliation by China.
>
> No deal is going to address all of Washington’s complaints fully. The best the U.S. and China can hope for is to find early opportunities for the latter to show its sincerity, to build the goodwill to tackle more difficult issues. The U.S. also has a responsibility to strengthen its own competitiveness, which will require balancing restrictions on Chinese access to U.S. technologies with its traditional openness to people and ideas that can help spur innovation. Allowing the talks to fail, and fostering open-ended trade conflict with China, would only weaken both countries, and the global economy as well.

> Should we conclude that a new “cold war” has begun? The answer is: yes and no...

> The conclusion is that across-the-board hostility towards China might be far more disruptive than the cold war. If, above all, the Chinese people were to be convinced that the west’s aim is to stop them from enjoying a better life, the hostility would be bottomless and endless. Co-operation would collapse. Yet no country can today be an island.
>
> It is not too late to avoid such a breakdown. The right path is to manage relations that will be both competitive and co-operative and so to recognise that China can be both foe and friend. In other words, we must embrace complexity. That is the path of maturity.
