[Xinjiang: phone app exposes how police monitor Uighur Muslims](https://www.ft.com/content/dfec4ac4-6bf5-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d) <br> *by Yuan Yang, from ft.com, 20190501*

> Police are monitoring Uighur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region via a smartphone app that accesses a vast array of personal information — from location data to whether they use WhatsApp — to flag “suspicious” behaviour, according to research by advocacy group Human Rights Watch.
>
> The app, used by police to access China's Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) — a mass surveillance database — was obtained and analysed by advocacy group Human Rights Watch in partnership with security research team Cure53.
>
> The discovery marks the deepest look the outside world has so far had into the tech-enabled authoritarianism of Beijing’s rule in Xinjiang, a region that has been all but closed off to diplomats and journalists.

[Chinese muscle stifles criticism of treatment of the Uighurs](https://www.ft.com/content/ebee2658-6b3c-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d) <br> *by Jamil Anderlini, from ft.com, 20190501*

> At any other time or in any other country, the incarceration of as many as 2m people on the basis of their religion would be a global scandal of epic proportions. But the relative indifference of the world to the plight of the Uighur ethnic minority and other Muslims in the western Chinese territory of Xinjiang is a sign of Beijing’s rising power and its ability to control global discourse well beyond its borders.

> Because of the size of its economy, and the unique nature of its authoritarian political system, China today is a punitive power in a way that no other country can be. The US is still able to punish countries by restricting or blocking access to global financial markets, but the range of issues that can land a country on an American blacklist is tiny compared with China’s list of grievances.

> Put it this way: mocking Donald Trump and his administration or criticising American policy will not trigger US sanctions. Countries, companies or, indeed, newspapers that attempt the same with Xi Jinping and China do so at their peril.

[The Communist Party grapples with a momentous anniversary](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/05/04/the-communist-party-grapples-with-a-momentous-anniversary) <br> *from economist.com, 20190502*

> Today May 4th is officially celebrated as Youth Day. Its significance is strongly contested. The party recalls the May 4th Movement, which refers to the protest in Tiananmen as well as similar ones elsewhere in China and intellectual soul-searching around that time, as the backdrop to the party’s birth two years later. Liberals remember the movement as a cry for democracy by patriots who believed that China had no hope of standing tall without adopting Western learning, including in politics. In a year packed with sensitive anniversaries—including the 30th on June 4th of the army’s crushing of student protests in the same square in 1989 (an event barely known to many young people in China, owing to the assiduous efforts of censors)—the party is bent on ensuring that its version of history is the only one heard.

> The party can at least claim to have fulfilled one dream of the protesters of 1919: China is now a global power (Mr Xi will be careful to ensure that his trade agreement with America’s president, Donald Trump, expected soon, does not look like surrender). But on April 30th, at a commemoration of the centenary in the Great Hall of the People next to Tiananmen, Mr Xi gave a veiled warning to dissidents. He described being unpatriotic as “disgraceful” and said that loving the country was closely entwined with loving the party and socialism. The traditional May Day public holiday was recently extended from three days to four. The party may hope to nudge Beijingers to enjoy a break outside the city and leave its history behind. The “spirit” of the centenary looks a lot like mistrust and fear.

[Huawei’s Communist Culture Limits its Global Ambitions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/technology/huawei-china-communist-party.html) <br> *by Li Yuan, from nytimes.com, 20190501*

> Today, 32 years after he founded the telecom giant with $3,000 of borrowed money, Mr. Ren is struggling to prove that Huawei is a private enterprise and independent of the Chinese government.
>
> The task is more urgent than ever. In recent months, the Trump administration has said China could use Huawei’s equipment [to spy on other countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/huawei-china-us-5g-technology.html?module=inline), though it hasn’t offered proof. Critics accuse the company of being controlled by the Chinese government. Huawei has repeatedly denied these allegations, saying it is [owned by its employees](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/technology/who-owns-huawei.html?module=inline) and [wouldn’t spy on its customers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/technology/huawei-ren-zhengfei.html?module=inline). 
>
> Regardless of the issues of ownership and control, which have been subjects of heated debate, Huawei’s struggle stems in part from its own internal conflict. The company has been deeply influenced by Western competitors. Huawei wants to help determine the world’s technological future, and Mr. Ren himself has said the company may need to adapt to get there. 
>
> But at its core, from its organizational structure to the way it builds employee loyalty, Huawei closely resembles the Chinese Communist Party itself.

[As Chinese Flock to Siberia’s Lake Baikal, Local Russians Growl](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/world/europe/chinese-lake-baikal-tourism-russia.html) <br> *by Neil MacFarquhar, from nytimes.com, 20190502*

> President Vladimir V. Putin pivoted toward China five years ago, after the annexation of Crimea soured relations with the West. China became Russia’s new best friend, allied through trade, diplomacy and even [military cooperation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/world/europe/russia-military-drills.html?module=inline) to counter American influence globally.

> Yet, this supposed new era of [Sino-Russian friendship i](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/57701)s exhibiting pronounced strains in Listvyanka, an old resort town on the lake, as an influx of Chinese tourists and businesses stirs recurrent Russian fears of a Chinese land grab and raises concerns about polluting the lake.
>
> At the same time the local authorities see in the flood of visitors the best hope they have for new jobs and economic development in an impoverished region.
