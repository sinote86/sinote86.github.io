> During the talks, the Chinese delegation proposed to the U.S. that Mr. Trump meet with Mr. Xi in the Chinese resort island of Hainan after his planned summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, in late February, people briefed on the talks said.
>
> At the meeting, Mr. Liu said China would buy 5 million tons of U.S. soybeans daily, a number Mr. Trump repeated, adding it would “make our farmers very happy.” The administration later clarified that China has agreed to buy an additional 5 million metric tons of soybeans—but not daily, and no time frame was specified.
>
> The development capped a day in which Mr. Trump sent what appeared to be mixed messages on prospects for a deal by the March 1 deadline.

> At the end of two days of negotiations in Washington, Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, said his talks with Liu He, China’s vice-premier, had finally centred on US demands for structural reforms by Beijing — such as ending the forced transfer of technology from US companies or reining in the use of industrial subsidies.
>
> But Mr Lighthizer failed to report a specific concession made by Beijing, and said he and Steven Mnuchin, US Treasury secretary, were considering a trip to Beijing after the Chinese new year celebration in early February to resume negotiations.
>
> “We focused on these core ideas, these core concepts and it’s my judgment that we made headway in significant ways,” Mr Lighthizer said on Thursday.

> In private conversations with his many foreign VIP friends, whose pictures hang on the walls of his offices in central Beijing, Mr Liu has often expressed bewilderment about how a country that he sees as a natural partner for China has become so hostile to it.
>
> People who meet him regularly say he often observes that the US has the world’s most powerful military, best universities and most advanced technologies, so why is it suddenly so hostile to a still much poorer China? 
>
> “He is from the old school of ‘let’s find ways to get along with the global community so that we can continue to do business’,” said one US executive who has met regularly with Mr Liu and his protégés.

## Slowdown

[China Slowdown Hits Growth Around the Globe](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-slowdown-causes-recoils-in-growth-around-the-globe-11548932400) <br> *by Chuin-Wei Yap & William Boston, from wsj.com, 20190131*

> Beijing’s struggle with domestic weaknesses, including a huge debt buildup, overinvestment and constraints on private businesses, are combining with trade tensions to drag down growth in the world’s second-largest economy to its slowest rate in three decades. The falloff in factory production and consumption is taking a toll on how much China buys from companies elsewhere in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. And the slowdown is rippling far beyond stock indexes, retarding economic growth far from China’s shores.
>
> Years of rapid growth have made China a major trading partner for countries around the world. Over the last decade, it accounted for a fifth of the total growth in global exports and imports, and played a key role in supporting demand during periods of weakness such as the eurozone’s financial crisis.

> Economic frailty in China now is felt everywhere...

> Trade tensions with the United States and a slowing economy are keeping Chinese tourists to budget-friendly destinations closer to home for the Lunar New Year holiday, with more likely opting for Bangkok than Sydney or San Francisco.

>
> Hotels and travel agencies in Asian countries from Thailand to Japan anticipate higher numbers than a year ago of Chinese tourists, who have become a powerful spending force with the ability to make, or break, the fortunes of retailers and tourism brands.

> But recently, the numbers going to the United States, Australia and New Zealand have fallen or only show small increases.

## Feature

> Until now links between social-realist cinema and “Peppa Pig”, a sweet British-made animated television series for children, have been hard to spot. Then came “What is Peppa?”, a beautifully crafted film about China’s rural-urban divide, family ties and the sadness of old age that has accumulated hundreds of millions of online views over the past few days.

> Officially, the six-minute short is an advertising trailer for a children’s feature film made for the China market, “Peppa Pig Celebrates Chinese New Year”. It is timed to cash in on the festival: day one of a pig-year in the Chinese zodiac falls on February 5th. Yet many grown-ups felt a pang of recognition as they watched the trailer’s bittersweet, live-action depiction of Li Yubao, a gruff-but-loving Chinese villager striving to please his city-dwelling grandson, notably by puzzling out the toddler’s request for a Peppa-themed gift. Filmed in the village of Waijinggou, in the dusty, hardscrabble hills that encircle northern Beijing, the short film is rather honest about modern inequalities. The mystery of Peppa’s identity is solved by a village woman who worked in Beijing as a nanny. When grandfather and toddler meet, the child’s eyes show fear at this wild-haired, over-loud old man, as well as excitement.
>
> Still, the film leaves a lot out. A true work of social realism, if set in a farming village in February 2019, would acknowledge a reality that Chinese officials and state media are trying to downplay. Rural China is in the grip of a long-feared catastrophe, an epidemic of African Swine Fever (ASF)...
