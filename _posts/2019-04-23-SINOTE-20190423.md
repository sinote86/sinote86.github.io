[China Isn’t Cheating on Trade](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/us-trade-hawks-exaggerate-chinas-threat/587536/) <br> *by Peter Beinart, from theatlantic.com, 20190421*

> In 1961, the psychologist Charles Osgood [warned](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1963-07933-001) of what he termed the “cold-war mentality”: a tendency “to perceive our adversaries as all bad and to perceive ourselves as all good.” Cold wars make it harder to acknowledge that competitors have legitimate fears and interests. It was a cold-war mentality that kept America’s leaders from recognizing that America’s foes in Vietnam saw themselves as fighting for national independence, not global communist domination.

> The perception that China is cheating America economically is having a similarly befogging effect today.
>
> Beijing’s economic policies are actually quite typical of a country at its stage of development. Like many regimes in the developing world, Beijing fears the “middle-income trap,” in which rising wages undermine its advantage as a center of low-cost manufacturing before it develops the capacity to produce higher-value goods. China worries that unless it moves from assembling iPhones to inventing them, economic growth will stagnate and popular unrest will follow.

[The Messy Truth About Social Credit](http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/messy-truth-about-social-credit) <br> *by Shazeda Ahmed, from chinafile.com, 20190422*

> Just because the social credit system is less comprehensive than it appears in foreign media reports does not mean that it is incapable of causing harm, of course. Moreover, the Chinese government maintains a sophisticated and pervasive surveillance apparatus, which it regularly uses to curtail the civil rights of its citizens...
>
> But the social credit system as it currently exists is not aimed at Orwellian social control. Rather, the cluster of policy initiatives designated by the term are intended to promote greater *trust*—namely, trust between companies and their customers, and between citizens and the government. This trust-building can serve both economic and political ends...
>
> Taken as a whole, the range of goals that the social credit system aims to address may suggest that the government is itself unsure, and is still in the process of figuring out, what such a system can accomplish. But the system’s most widely publicized aspect in China is how it punishes those deemed “untrustworthy”—which is also where the greatest potential for harm lies. Yet the techniques that the Chinese government is using to enact these punishments are not especially unique—some of them are already ubiquitous in the United States. In fact, the two countries’ approach to trust-building is more similar than one might expect.

[Xi’s Unsteady Steps Revive Worries Over Lack of Succession Plan in China](https://www.wsj.com/articles/xis-unsteady-steps-revive-worries-over-lack-of-succession-plan-in-china-11556011802) <br> *by Chun Han Wong, from wsj.com, 20190423*

> Television coverage of Mr. Xi’s visits to Italy, Monaco and France last month appeared to show him walking with a slight limp while [inspecting honor guards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2cRL_imI6k&mod=article_inline) and [touring local sights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZFHO2fzmi8&feature=youtu.be&mod=article_inline). At a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Xi gripped both arms on his chair to support himself as he sat down, [news footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Bv2qMmqsE&mod=article_inline) showed.
>
> These images stirred speculation about Mr. Xi’s health among politically minded Chinese, foreign diplomats and China watchers, who quietly wondered if the Chinese leader, who turns 66 in June, had an ailment that caused him physical discomfort. Guessing games have played out on overseas Chinese news outlets and social media, where users offered theories from muscle sprains to gout.
>
> Mr. Xi has been publicly visible in China since the trip, including an appearance on a warship on Tuesday during a celebration of the 70th anniversary of China’s navy. 
>
> But the videos from Europe fueled “a little discussion” among some Chinese intellectuals in private social-media chat rooms, said a retired politics professor in Beijing. “Everyone didn’t say much, but there was a tacit mutual understanding.”

[China’s maritime ambitions are becoming more evident](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/04/23/chinas-maritime-ambitions-are-becoming-more-evident) <br> *from economist.com, 20190423*

> As military pageants go, multinational parades of warships deliver quite a complex message. Over a dozen countries—ranging from friends to overt rivals—sent naval vessels to the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao on April 23rd. There they steamed past a destroyer carrying China’s commander-in-chief, President Xi Jinping, in honour of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army Navy.

> Paint gleaming and brass fittings buffed to a hospital shine, there were frigates from near-allies such as Russia, and destroyers from almost-foes like India. Their mission was friendship and diplomacy. But these were heavily armed peace envoys, warily visiting a China whose emergence as an ocean-going nation is shaking Asia, and may one day change the world. Visitors involved in territorial disputes with China, including Japan and Vietnam, sent ships bristling with advanced weaponry. America sent no ships at all.
>
> China sent mixed messages, too...

[The forgotten victims of China’s Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/23/forgotten-victims-chinas-belt-road-initiative/) <br> *by Jerome A. Cohen, from washingtonpost.com, 20190423*

> Deep in debt, without passports, and lacking access to transportation and independent advice, Chinese workers are often left to endure these conditions without recourse. Those lacking proper visas are subject to quick deportation and are thus even more vulnerable. Language barriers make effective complaining to the host government difficult, and the Chinese embassy or consulate may be hours away. Those workers who are courageous enough to protest their maltreatment have been beaten by their employers or arrested and deported by local authorities.
>
> So why should China care? Aside from a duty to protect its citizens, these conditions frustrate China’s broader objectives for the Belt and Road Initiative, such as building “win-win” projects, “people-to-people” connections and soft power. If Chinese executives are eventually jailed and projects stalled, companies and lenders will lose money. Employing flocks of often illegal Chinese migrants housed in Chinese enclaves fuels resentment amongst locals, while subjecting its citizens to abusive and unsafe work conditions inevitably hurts China’s image. Rampant immigration and labor violations have already caused officials in some jurisdictions to [question](https://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/support-shortening-tourists-stay-scrapped/) lax visa policies that previously welcomed Chinese.
