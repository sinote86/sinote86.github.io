> Australia is investigating the detention of a prominent Chinese-Australian writer who has been held by Chinese authorities while travelling in China.
>
> The Australian embassy on Wednesday said Beijing had confirmed it was holding Yang Hengjun, and was seeking to clarify the nature of his detention and to obtain consular access.
>
> The detention of Mr Yang, an Australian citizen, comes as at least two Canadians are still being held in China in apparent retaliation for the arrest of Huawei’s finance chief, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver last month.

['I'm being watched': Anne-Marie Brady, the China critic living in fear of Beijing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/23/im-being-watched-anne-marie-brady-the-china-critic-living-in-fear-of-beijing) <br> *by Eleanor Ainge Roy, from theguardian.com, 20190123*

> Brady has spent more than 25 years researching the Chinese Communist party (CCP), using her base in New Zealand as a refuge to work on her books, cook elaborate meals for her family and tend her vegetable and flower gardens.
>
> But since the publication of her [2017 paper Magic Weapons](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/magic_weapons.pdf), which details the extent of Chinese influence in New Zealand, Brady’s life has been turned upside down, becoming the target of a campaign of intimidation and “psy-ops” she believes is directed by Beijing towards her and her family. The Chinese government has not responded to requests for comment.

[China detains students, labor activists in deepening crackdown](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-labour-rights/china-detains-students-labor-activists-in-deepening-crackdown-idUSKCN1PH0HS) <br> *by Christian Shepherd & Sue-Lin Wong, from reuters.com, 20190123*

> About a dozen Chinese labor activists and university students have either gone missing or been detained by police this week, sources told Reuters, amid a deepening crackdown on activists seeking improved rights for factory workers. 
>
> A loose but active coalition of workers, activists and students across China has since July 2018 faced off against police, with dozens detained over their support for workers who protested after being blocked from forming a labor union with leaders of their choice. 
>
> The clampdown has spread to top universities, with some students being detained and, they say, threatened by police.

[Making China Communist Again?](https://thediplomat.com/2019/01/making-china-communist-again/) <br> *by William Hurst, from thediplomat.com, 20190123*

> The Chinese government and Communist Party have always been wary of any opposition, although relatively tolerant of local-level dissent, provided the economy kept growing and that the targets of any contention were far below the top of the political hierarchy.
>
> Today many factors have changed in ways that have given rise to a “perfect storm” of both activism and brute-force repression unlike anything China has seen in recent decades. Critical aspects of this round of cat-and-mouse diverge from past patterns in ways that portend greater strife in China’s future.
>
> The new environment has produced a situation more volatile than anything we’ve seen in China in almost 30 years. University students are rediscovering Marx and Mao and taking their ideas seriously. Student activists are then making common cause and connecting with elements of the working class to an extent unimaginable since the days when workers manned barricades to defend students in 1989.  And the state and Party have become remarkably less tolerant of even the mildest challenge or criticism.

## Slowdown

> China has already pivoted towards more supportive economic policies. It has sped up spending on infrastructure, trimmed income taxes and relaxed some restraints on bank lending. This does not add up to a big stimulus package, but the direction is clear. If growth slows further, as seems likely, the government will move more boldly still.
>
> There is no doubt that China would like to persuade Mr Trump to roll back tariffs on Chinese goods, which would both help its exporters and boost market sentiment. Bilateral talks are grinding on ahead of a March 1st deadline. Chinese negotiators are working on an offer that will satisfy their American counterparts, combining pledges to buy more American goods with reforms to treat foreign companies more fairly. But if Mr Trump truly believes what he tweets about the Chinese economy, he is at risk of overestimating the strength of America’s hand. China wants a trade deal, certainly, but it is not desperate. 

[China Risks Real Hard Landing This Time](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-risks-real-hard-landing-this-time-11548241946) <br> *by Nathaniel Taplin, from wsj.com, 20190123*

> China’s economy is at risk of its long-feared “hard landing”—a rapid slowdown in growth that would hit employment hard and could trigger big problems in global debt and currency markets.
>
> The reason isn’t, as the Trump administration would like to believe, the U.S.’s trade offensive. Instead, Beijing has overdone its own crackdown on nonbank “shadow finance”—without opening alternative channels for private-sector borrowers, who often struggle to obtain bank credit. As a result, Chinese credit growth has continued to decelerate, despite nine months of significant central bank easing. If it doesn’t turn back up soon, producer-price inflation could turn negative—causing big problems in the heavily indebted industrial sector.

## Feature

[Super-Patriotic Anime Youth Wars!](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/23/super-patriotic-anime-youth-wars-china-japan-pop-culture/) <br> *by Tanner Greer, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190123*

> Japanese anime has conquered China. In Chinese, the term “2D culture” (erciyuan wenhua) describes both the television shows, video games, anime (cartoons), manga (comic books), music, and movies inspired by Japanese pop culture and the millions of Chinese who consume these products every week. This “second dimension” is one of the fastest-growing industries in China—with more than 200 million consumers, the market is projected to reach more than $30 billion by 2020.
>
> But the runaway success of Japanese pop culture among China’s youth has caused confusion, shock, and anger in a country still bitter over historical grievances. Many Chinese see this as a war for the hearts of their children—one they’re losing.
>
> This conflict is being fought out in editorial pages, boardrooms, and government bureaus. The stakes couldn’t be higher: in the short term, tens of billions of dollars; in the long term, the future of Sino-Japanese relations. Japanese diplomats hope that the millions of young Chinese in the 2D world will push for a China friendlier to Japan and its people. The Chinese Communist Party has responded by developing its own anime and manga-based propaganda program. Below all this are the parents and grandparents, aware that their children and grandchildren are submerging themselves in a subculture designed to exclude them—one generated by the same country that inflicted two decades of horror on China. Some accept this as a natural expression of youth; for many others, it’s a terrible disaster.
