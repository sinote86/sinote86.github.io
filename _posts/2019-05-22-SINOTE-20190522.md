[How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html) <br> *by Chris Buckley & Paul Mozur, from nytimes.com, 20190522*

> A God’s-eye view of Kashgar, an ancient city in western China, flashed onto a wall-size screen, with colorful icons marking police stations, checkpoints and the locations of recent security incidents. At the click of a mouse, a technician explained, the police can pull up live video from any surveillance camera or take a closer look at anyone passing through one of the thousands of checkpoints in the city.

> To demonstrate, she showed how the system could retrieve the photo, home address and official identification number of a woman who had been stopped at a checkpoint on a major highway. The system sifted through billions of records, then displayed details of her education, family ties, links to an earlier case and recent visits to a hotel and an internet cafe.
>
> The simulation, presented at an industry fair in China, offered a rare look at a system that now peers into nearly every corner of Xinjiang, the troubled region where Kashgar is located.
>
> This is the vision of high-tech surveillance — precise, all-seeing, infallible — that China’s leaders are investing billions of dollars in every year, [making Xinjiang an incubator for increasingly intrusive policing systems](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-china-surveillance-prison.html?module=inline) that could spread across the country and beyond.

> News that former China Securities Regulatory Commission head Liu Shiyu is [being investigated](https://www.ft.com/content/5bf2f286-7a5f-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560) for suspected rules violations has raised questions over the high level of personal risk taken on by the country’s financial regulators.

> Market watchers, who knew the 57 year old as an effective central banker and a staunch advocate for financial reform, have been puzzled and alarmed by Mr Liu’s fall from grace leading some to suspect senior figures are being blamed for turbulence in global markets.

> “Whoever holds the job of China’s markets regulator should be worried,” said Minxin Pei, a Chinese politics expert at Claremont McKenna College in the US. “For some reason they are held personally responsible for the performance of the stock market.”

[A Political Economist on How China Sees Trump’s Trade War](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/a-political-economist-on-how-china-sees-trumps-trade-war) <br> *by Isaac Chotiner, from newyorker.com, 20190522*

> Earlier this month, after trade talks with China collapsed, President Trump ramped up his [trade war](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/china-trade-tariffs.html), raising tariffs from ten to twenty-five per cent on a third of Chinese imports, about two hundred and fifty billion dollars’ worth of goods. In response, U.S. markets have become jumpy, and economists have grown more concerned about prospects for economic growth. But less attention has been paid in the United States to what this trade war means for China’s economy and the political fortunes of its President, Xi Jinping. I recently spoke by phone with Victor Shih, a professor of political economy at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, who studies Chinese economic policy. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the biggest dangers to the Chinese economy, what the Communist Party thinks of President Trump, and whether China has entered a new era of repression.

> When Donald Trump first took office in 2017, officials in Beijing saw a pragmatic businessman: All that tough campaign talk, they argued, was merely Art-of-the-Deal negotiating tactics rather than deeply held beliefs.
>
> Yet more than two years later, President Xi Jinping finds himself on the verge of a new Cold War his government sees fanned by Washington’s most ideological China hawks. What’s worse, the view that China is a strategic competitor that must be thwarted at all costs is picking up supporters across the U.S. political spectrum by the day.

They are stoking up anti-U.S. sentiment and drawing up contingency plans to bail out Huawei, while also still calling for dialogue to resolve the dispute.
