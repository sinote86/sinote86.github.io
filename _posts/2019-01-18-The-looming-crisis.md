## Slowdown

[China’s Looming Crisis: A Shrinking Population](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/17/world/asia/china-population-crisis.html) <br> *by Steven Lee Myers, Jin Wu & Claire Fu, from nytimes.com, 20190117*

> The looming demographic crisis could be the Achilles heel of China’s stunning economic transformation over the last 40 years.
>
> The declining population could create an even greater burden on China’s economy and its labor force. With fewer workers in the future, the government could struggle to pay for a population that is growing older and living longer.
>
> A decline in the working-age population could also slow consumer spending and thus have an impact on the economy in China and beyond.

[Forget the Trade War. China Is Already in Crisis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-17/forget-the-trade-war-china-is-already-in-crisis) <br> *by Michael Schuman, from bloomberg.com, 20190117*

> What goes widely unnoticed is that China is already in crisis. No, it’s not the sort of hold-on-for-dear-life collapse the U.S. had in 2008 or the surprising, ferocious meltdowns the Asian Tiger economies experienced in 1997. Nonetheless, it’s a crisis, complete with gutted banks, bankrupt companies, and state bailouts. Since the Chinese distinguish their model of state capitalism as “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” let’s call this a “financial crisis with Chinese attributes.”
>
> This crisis is not merely about the current slowdown in growth. It’s been going on for a while, and by the looks of it, isn’t going away anytime soon. How it’s resolved—or isn’t—will have repercussions much bigger than a few quarters of poor growth performance. This crisis is about China’s economic future and whether or not it can manage the structural transformation necessary to propel the economy into the ranks of the world’s most advanced. And it also will determine if China will be a pillar of global growth—or a threat to the world’s financial stability.

[China's case of 'cakeism'](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/01/18/1547804776000/China-s-case-of--cakeism-/) <br> *by Colby Smith, from ft.com, 20190118*

> Alphaville sat down with economist George Magnus, a former senior adviser to UBS Investment Bank and the recent author of "Red Flags: Why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy." He describes what's happening in China this way: "At the moment, we've got an incoherence of policy. It's confusing to us looking at it from the outside. It must be incredibly confusing if you are an entrepreneur or small business on the inside."
>
> China's version of "cakeism," he says, centers around the leadership's conflicting commitments to de-risking the financial system on one hand and on the other, hitting elevated growth targets north of 6 per cent. "You can't really have a determined effort to deleverage the economy and not expect it to have a material impact on economic growth," points out Magnus.

[Cautious consumers feel the pinch as Chinese economy slows](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/18/cautious-consumers-chinese-economy-slows) <br> *by Lily Kuo, from theguardian.com, 20190118*

> For the many businesses that depend on the spending power of China’s middle class, winter has already arrived. After decades of breakneck growth, the world’s second largest economy is slowing down, and Chinese consumers are feeling the pinch.

> Some argue that the idea of a “consumption downgrade” is overblown and that falling iPhone sales are no barometer of the broader economy. “Apple has been losing relevance in the Chinese market for a variety of reasons in recent years. The brand no longer excites Chinese consumers,” said Pan Yiling, senior editor of Jing Daily, which focuses on the Chinese luxury market.
>
> Pan says China’s middle class consumers are becoming more strategic. Those who enjoy luxury brands are cutting back on impulsive purchases and choosing more carefully.

## China-US

[Assessing U.S.-China relations 2 years into the Trump presidency](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/01/15/assessing-u-s-china-relations-2-years-into-the-trump-presidency/) <br> *by David Dollar, from brookings.edu, 20190115*

> The Trump administration has disrupted a longstanding bipartisan consensus on U.S. policy toward China, which it viewed as overly timid and insufficiently robust in responding to China’s excesses. Although past policy shifted based on events, it largely was grounded in a judgment that U.S. interests would be served by a constructive relationship with China that mitigated risk of conflict and maximized opportunities for cooperation in areas of converging interests, such as North Korea and climate change.
>
> U.S. policy toward China now appears animated by a judgment that the past trajectory of the bilateral relationship favored China and disadvantaged the United States in a long-run competition for global leadership. To try to break that trajectory, the Trump administration over the past two years has adopted an increasingly zero-sum, unilateralist, protectionist, and nativist “America first” approach to the relationship. But if the aim is to influence Chinese behavior, the administration will need to demonstrate considerably more focus in strategic thinking, time, resources, and coordination with partners.

> China will not crumble as the Soviet Union did. Its technology and industrial bases are far too strong and its economic and diplomatic links around the world far too deep. Nor will it bow to US threats. Unlike Japan, China is not part of the American security umbrella, and not dependent on US goodwill. China’s products around the world sell because they are high quality, less costly, and often cutting edge.
>
> Today’s trade brinkmanship has rising global costs. The world economy is gradually being dislocated by Mr Trump’s impetuousness. Business investments are increasingly stymied by uncertainty. The US president may do the remarkable disservice of turning synchronised global growth in 2018 into a synchronised slowdown this year and next. The renminbi will depreciate significantly if China is pushed too hard, causing further dislocations.

> How can the United States and China peacefully manage their growing bilateral competition? In this podcast, Paul Haenle spoke with Graham Allison, Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at Harvard University, about the Thucydides Trap and its relevance to the U.S.-China relationship.

> Allison says the Thucydides Trap is the best framework to understand why there is potential for conflict between the United States and China. As China grew stronger, the U.S. failed to recognize Beijing would increasingly assert its own vision for the international order, thereby challenging the American-led global system. China now represents both a strategic rival and partner for the United States. The bilateral relationship needs a new framework that accounts for significant areas of competition and cooperation. Allison says the United States and China share vital national interests in ensuring the survival of their respective nations and must work to resolve issues clouding the economic relationship. This includes devising a new set of rules that accounts for China’s unprecedented economic development and status as a global power. For guidance, policymakers should look to John F. Kennedy’s post-Cuban Missile Crisis call for a world “safe for diversity.” This would allow nations with different political systems, economic development models, and ideologies to compete in peaceful coexistence.
