> The BBC has been given rare access to the vast system of highly secure facilities thought to be holding more than a million Muslims in China’s western region of Xinjiang.
>
> Authorities there insist they are just training schools. But the BBC’s visit uncovers important evidence about the nature of the system and the conditions for the people inside it.

> The BBC's China Correspondent John Sudworth sent this report.

[A Muslim Family Sought Help at the Belgian Embassy in Beijing. The Police Dragged Them Out.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighurs-belgium.html) <br> *by Jane Perlez, from nytimes.com, 20190618*

> The last time Abdulhamid Tursun spoke to his wife, she was huddled in a Beijing hotel room with their four children, frightened after being evicted from the Belgian Embassy in the dead of night. Suddenly, plainclothes police officers burst into the room, cutting off the couple’s video call.
>
> Mr. Tursun says he has not heard from her since.
>
> His wife, Wureyetiguli Abula, 43, had gone to the Belgian Embassy to seek visas so the family — from the Uighur Muslim minority group — could be reunited with Mr. Tursun, 51, in Brussels, where he won asylum in 2017.
>
> But instead of finding protection, Ms. Abula and her children, ages 5 to 17, were dragged away after the Chinese police were allowed to enter the embassy.

## Hong Kong

[How Hong Kong defied Xi Jinping](https://www.ft.com/content/d0aa598a-90f2-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2) <br> *by Tom Mitchell, Sue-Lin Wong & Nicolle Liu, from ft.com, 20190618*

> The protesters’ gains have been Mr Xi’s loss. Even though his proxy in the territory, Ms Lam, has accepted responsibility for the debacle, it is a stunning setback for a man regarded as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Chinese officials publicly backed Ms Lam’s proposed changes to the extradition bill — even though they later said it was her idea — after they were introduced in February. This put Beijing’s credibility on the line as the crisis escalated.

> ...
>
> This pattern of failure poses a greater dilemma for Mr Xi. Does his administration abandon the heavy-handed treatment it has meted out to Hong Kong since he came to power in 2012, or does the party — at the risk of further alienating the city’s youth — double down on its hardball tactics that have included disqualifications of pro-democracy legislators and convictions or prison terms for leaders of the umbrella revolution.
>
> Many people are betting that Mr Xi will adopt the latter approach as the party escalates its rhetoric about foreign plots allegedly hatched to “destabilise” Hong Kong. Neither “street violence nor the ill-intentioned interventions of foreign governments” could shake Beijing’s support for Hong Kong’s chief executive, the official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Monday. 
>
> But for Beijing it is still a high-stakes gamble. At least 60 per cent of overseas direct investment into China flows through the city — and it remains the primary offshore [market for the renminbi, ](https://www.ft.com/content/e480fd92-bc6a-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080)which the People’s Bank of China one day hopes to make a truly international currency.

[Hong Kong Was a Refuge for Mainland Chinese. The Extradition Bill Could Change That.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-bill-china.html) <br> *by Emily Steel & Cao Li, from nytimes.com, 20190618*

> Minnie Li understands what is at stake with the [contentious Hong Kong bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-bill.html?module=inline) that would allow extraditions to China. A Shanghai native, she moved to Hong Kong in 2008 to study sociology and then stayed, she said, because she enjoyed its freedom of speech and other civil liberties that are absent in her increasingly authoritarian homeland.
>
> Ms. Li is so worried that the proposed law would toll the bell on human rights in Hong Kong that she joined nearly a dozen other activists last week in a 103-hour hunger strike. She sat on a bridge enduring the blazing heat, pouring rain and riot police shooting tear gas at protesters below her — under an orange banner that said in Chinese, “Hunger strike to show my determination.”
>
> For many mainland Chinese, Hong Kong has long been a refuge that affords a relatively high degree of safety while also serving as a way to stay connected to the mainland. If passed, the extradition bill could change all that.

[A $300 Billion Rainbow Economy Is Booming in the Middle of China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-18/chengdu-is-tapping-into-china-s-300-billion-rainbow-economy) <br> *by Bloomberg News, from bloomberg,com, 20190618*

> It’s 11 p.m. at AMO, an underground lesbian nightclub in Chengdu, and 17 women—in androgynous clothing, their hair closely cropped—line up at the front door to welcome partygoers. Among them is Yang Yang, 25, who started working at AMO (Esperanto for “love”) more than three years ago when she moved to the Sichuan capital in the southwest of China. In that time she’s earned enough to buy a 645-square-foot loft. “I can have fun and drink while making money,” says Yang, who’d trained to be a kindergarten teacher. “How much better does it get than that?”
>
> Yang, her workplace, and her apartment are all part of China’s growing rainbow economy: the ecosystem of consumers, companies, and workers that serve the nation’s LGBT population. State media estimate that this segment of the nation’s economy is worth $300 billion a year—making it the world’s third-largest after Europe and the U.S., they say—fueling a consumer base that companies are eagerly, if cautiously, trying to tap.

> A world away from Beijing, Chengdu has become a haven for the LGBT community, whose members are drawn to the relaxed, open vibe. The city sits in a basin surrounded by mountains, which kept it isolated for centuries. Fertile ground and abundant natural resources allowed it to stay mostly self-sufficient, with an attitude that’s both “mind your own business” and “anything goes.” The city of 16 million, best [known internationally for its pandas](http://www.panda.org.cn/english/about/about/2013-09-11/2416.html), was voted the gay capital of China in a recent poll by gay dating app Blued. Less-expensive rents have lured young people, cultivating a hip, progressive culture that’s spawned San Francisco-style cafes filled with millennials. Economic growth is comfortable, with last year’s 8% expansion well above the national rate.
