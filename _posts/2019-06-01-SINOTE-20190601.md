## 1989

[How today’s China was shaped by the events in Tiananmen Square 30 years ago](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/how-todays-china-was-shaped-by-the-events-in-tiananmen-square-30-years-ago/2019/06/01/21119780-7708-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html) <br> *by Gerry Shih, from washingtonpost.com, 20190601*

> This is the China of today: supremely confident, richer than it could have imagined three decades ago, and more convinced than ever of the rightness of its repressive model of authoritarian political control.
>
> In many ways, this is a direct result of a seismic event that took place 30 years ago Tuesday. On June 4, 1989, unknown numbers of Chinese — hundreds or perhaps thousands — were killed by their own military in response to a huge gathering in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to call for change.
>
> ...
>
> After the blood had been washed from the streets, the Communist Party began the great reshaping of the country. It created an implicit compact with the people: You can have economic growth, but you can’t have political freedom.
>
> This bifurcation is more apparent than ever as President Xi Jinping enters his seventh year at the helm of China.

> Our movement failed 30 years ago because we lacked support and experience in promoting democratic change. Many of us had pinned our hopes on the liberal factions of the Communist Party leadership to initiate changes from within the system, but we underestimated the power of the party elders. The massacre shattered our illusions, helping us see the brutality of China’s one-party rule.
>
> We students were not the only naïve ones. Within a few years of the Tiananmen massacre, many Western governments lifted their sanctions against China. The West’s engagement policy — based on the hope that trade and investment would bring about democratic changes in China — prevailed. 
>
> But instead of instigating liberalization, Western capital fattened the pockets of the Communist Party leaders, giving them the power to prolong their rule by silencing dissent at home and expanding the country’s global clout.

> Thirty years ago in the spring of 1989, as the world’s most populous country teetered on the edge of freedom, I received a late-night phone call in my apartment in Beijing: The Chinese Army was invading its own capital.
>
> Students and workers had made roads impassable by setting up barricades to block the army, so I jumped on my bicycle and pedaled furiously toward the gunfire. I reached Tiananmen Square shortly before the army, and then I watched as soldiers fired their automatic weapons directly at the crowd that I was in.
>
> I was then the Beijing bureau chief of The Times, and I ran around that evening, the notebook clutched in my hand stained with the sweat of fear, to document horrors that remain seared into my memory. You never forget watching young people, some of the nation’s best and brightest, full of passion and idealism, stand up to machine guns — and then in an instant crumple bloody and lifeless on the ground.

> There are no official acts of remembrance for the events of 1989 in Beijing. But that statement, although factually correct, is far too neutral.
>
> In truth, what happened in Tiananmen Square is marked faithfully each year by a massive, national act of what might more properly be called "forgettance".

> What do the Chinese youths of today know about the deadly crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989? What do they think about their generation’s prospects for making change?
>
> We asked five 20-somethings about what they want for their country’s future.
>
> We have preserved their anonymity to avoid placing them in jeopardy with China’s security services.

> Since 2013, I’ve been losing hope. We can’t find a way to make China better and more democratic. I feel so frustrated with my history. Even at my age, it’s so hard to bear it. We carry the burden of political and psychological repression. I even have to hide my political thoughts from my parents.

> I admit that there are some problems with China’s current governance, but we don’t have an alternative political force as capable and efficient as the Communist Party to run things and unite a country of 1.4 billion people. The biggest problem right now is that some people don’t have enough confidence or faith in the party, which has led to political confusion and thus made President Xi’s campaign for greater ideological control all the more relevant.

> I’m optimistic about the economy but not about human rights or freedom of speech. That’s getting worse and worse. I know what the technology can do now, so I know there’s never going to be another June 4 in China. It’s impossible with all the IT and surveillance systems. They can nip any protest in the bud.
>
> **Undergraduate student, 25**

> I don’t think there will be any kind of democracy in China. We just have to grab little bits here and there. We can try to expand what the press can do and enlarge our limited freedoms a bit. Maybe they can allow NGOs or we can improve women’s rights or workers’ rights or the situation of minorities. But it’s difficult because all of this is highly dangerous in China.

> Today, Chinese millennials generally show an apathy to politics because deep down we fear [what happened to the protesters would happen to us] and don’t dare confront the ruling party. We are a more selfish generation, which can be both a good and bad thing. My biggest hope is to live to see a spiritual leader that helps restore the backbone, the strength of courage this nation lost in the 1989 catastrophe.
