[Liu Xia Rebuilds Her Career as an Artist](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/liu-xia-rebuilds-her-career-as-an-artist) <br> *by Nick Frisch, from newyorker.com, 20190430*

> In June of 2017, the Chinese government announced that Xiaobo had been [diagnosed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/liu-xiaobo-chinas-prescient-dissident)with liver cancer. The disease was already advanced. Less than three weeks later, [he was dead](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-unbroken-liu-xiaobo). Liu, who had suffered depression and heart problems during her house arrest, became desperate. “Xiaobo has gone. It would be easier to die than to live,” she said in a [phone conversation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/world/asia/china-germany-liu-xia.html), in 2018, with Liao Yiwu, a dissident friend and poet living in exile in Berlin. “Nothing would be simpler for me than dying in defiance.” Liao released a recording of the call in the hope of calling attention to Liu’s plight. Supporters around the world rallied for her release. Last July, after months of lobbying by the German government, government security agents escorted her to the Beijing airport and she was put on a flight, via Helsinki, to Berlin.

> Not long after, I met Liu at a potluck dinner at Liao’s home, a short walk from Theodor-Heuss-Platz, in western Berlin. A few other guests were there, including Liu’s nephew, who was visiting from the United States, and a Chinese-German interpreter who has worked on sensitive diplomatic cases like Liu’s. When I arrived, Liao’s wife was in the kitchen, stuffing dumpling skins with pork and chives. In the back yard, a long table was spread with fruits, beer, and wine. Liu lounged in a chair at one end, her slight frame draped in loose black clothes, smoking one slim Davidoff cigarette after another. A friend periodically brought over a smartphone, which was pinging with text messages and calls for Liu from well-wishers in the dissident diaspora, many of them longtime supporters of her husband. Liu received their words stoically, tapping tentatively at the device’s screen. (Before that week, she had barely used a smartphone.) As guests chatted around her, in Mandarin mixed with German and English, she mostly sat in unnerving quiet, her attention seeming to wander in and out of the conversation.

[The China Question: Time for a New Approach to Beijing](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-china-question-time-for-a-new-approach-to-beijing-a-1264948.html) <br> *by Bernhard Zand, from spiegel.de, 20190430*

> The contradictions of modern China are so extreme that they prompt extreme reactions, ranging from uncritical admiration, particularly in business circles, to flat-out rejection of the "Chinese model," especially among human rights activists. 
>
> Beijing's juggernaut development drive represents both a political and intellectual challenge. It is difficult to form a consistent opinion of a country whose size, population and complexity are comparable more to a continent than to a Western nation-state. Do the conditions inherent to China's transformation justify the methods employed by its government? Do these methods devalue what the Chinese have achieved over the past 40 years? What concrete conclusions can be drawn?
>
> There can be no conclusive answers to such questions because modern China remains a work in progress. Although the political leadership is endeavoring to convey the impression of dynastic stability and has declared Xi as head of state for life, the country is still undergoing massive changes. This year marks the anniversary of three events that have shaped the contradictions, image and self-image of today's China.

[Xi Praises a Student Protest in China. From 100 Years Ago.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-speech-may-4-protest.html) <br> *by Chris Buckley & Amy Qin, from nytimes.com, 20190429*

> One hundred years after thousands of Chinese students marched on Tiananmen Square in a watershed revolt, President Xi Jinping seized on the event Tuesday to burnish his brand of authoritarian nationalism. Mr. Xi gave a stark display of the Communist Party’s determination to control the legacy of the movement that has inspired both friends and foes of party rule.
>
> The May 4, 1919, protest against Western colonialism had inflamed Chinese nationalism and helped spread a wave of ideas rejecting Chinese tradition and hierarchy. In a speech marking the centenary of the event, Mr. Xi extolled the patriotic image of May 4 while ignoring its anti-authority themes.

> Rank-and-file tech workers in China, discouraged by a [weakened job market](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/business/china-economy-slowdown-white-collar-workers.html) and downbeat about their odds of joining the digital aristocracy, have other ideas.

> They are organizing online against what in China is called the “996” culture: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. 
>
> For years, Chinese tech employees have worked hours that make Silicon Valley’s workaholics seem pampered. Now they are naming and shaming employers that demand late nights. Some programmers are even [withholding their creations](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU/blob/master/awesomelist/README.md) from companies that they think overemphasize 996.
>
> “Ten years ago, people rarely complained about 996,” said Li Shun, a former employee at the search giant Baidu who left to found an online medical start-up. “This industry was booming once, but it’s more of a normal industry now. There are no more giant financial returns. Expecting people to work a 996 schedule on their own like before isn’t realistic.”

> Unusually for China — where independent labor unions are banned and the government comes down hard on populist movements it doesn’t control — the movement is gaining traction.
