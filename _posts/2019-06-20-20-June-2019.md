[A policy U-turn puts Hong Kong’s leader in a precarious position](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/20/a-policy-u-turn-puts-hong-kongs-leader-in-a-precarious-position) <br> *from economist.com, 20190620*

> Central government representatives strongly backed the bill after it was introduced. They lobbied legislators to support it. They even invited foreign journalists in Hong Kong to tea to suggest they “inject positivity” into their coverage of it. But they are likely to be relieved by Mrs Lam’s willingness to take the blame for the crisis that has ensued. This year is one of huge symbolic importance for the party; it took over exactly 70 years ago. China’s leaders would not want the build-up to the anniversary on October 1st to be marred by unrest blamed on their own misjudgment.
>
> The party has continued to express support for Mrs Lam. At her news conference on June 18th she deflected repeated questions about whether she would step down, as protesters have demanded. It is possible that the party has not identified someone who it believes would do a better job than Mrs Lam, who has three more years to serve of her five-year term.
>
> If the party wants her to go, it may wait until her term ends, and then insist that she not stand again. To change Hong Kong’s leader now would be risky. It would re-open questions about how Hong Kong’s leaders are chosen. Public anger over the process, which is conducted by a committee dominated by party loyalists in Hong Kong, sparked the Umbrella Movement.

[As Hong Kong Erupted Over Extradition Bill, City’s Tycoons Waited and Worried](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/business/hong-kong-business-extradition.html) <br> *by Alexandra Stevenson & Keith Bradsher, from nytimes.com, 20190620*

> As the fight over Hong Kong’s future rages, its business leaders — once the city’s biggest power brokers — are in a position that is growing more precarious. China’s rise has enriched Hong Kong, but it has also emboldened Beijing [to take a greater hand in the city’s affairs](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/world/asia/hong-kong-china.html?module=inline). 
>
> That stronger hand threatens Hong Kong’s future as a global commercial hub, but business leaders increasingly fear resisting a Chinese government that does not tolerate dissent.
>
> Outside pressures also played a role in the business leaders’ speaking out. Local tycoons were spooked by rising threats by lawmakers in the United States to reconsider an American policy granting special trade status to Hong Kong, raising the prospect that the city could become another front in President Trump’s trade war with China.

> Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets of Hong Kong last Sunday and marched almost two miles (three kilometers), protesting a proposed extradition bill and calling for the city’s leader to step down.
>
> It was the largest of three protests against the bill that were held over eight days. A [new protest](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/world/asia/hong-kong.html) was scheduled for Friday morning. The composite images below help show the enormous scale of Sunday’s demonstrations.

> A bit late, China’s leaders are starting to accept that their trade war with President Donald Trump is only one element of a larger crisis in relations with America—and not the most dangerous one. The leaders understand that their critics within America’s foreign-policy and national-security machine—meaning aides to Mr Trump, members of both parties in Congress and officers in the State Department, Pentagon, spy agencies and beyond—want China to change its ways. They also believe (or hope) that Mr Trump wants something different, and perhaps less painful for them: to show voters the spectacle of China losing a trade fight with him.
>
> China’s rulers now accept that they face more than a Trump problem. They concede that bipartisan suspicion of China in America will intensify in the run-up to the elections of November 2020, and will continue afterwards, whoever wins. They absorbed that message during visits by high-ranking Americans, including Mr Trump’s officials, business bosses and veterans of Republican and Democratic governments. Dismayingly, they show no sign of accepting that China’s own actions are in any way to blame.

[Shanghai Sacred: inside China's religious revival – photo essay](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/20/shanghai-sacred-inside-chinas-religious-revival-photo-essay) <br> *from theguardian.com, 20190620*

> With more than 24 million residents, Shanghai is China’s largest city and the 10th wealthiest in the world. It is famous for economic dynamism and architectural daring, and has become synonymous with consumerism. At the same time, it is at the forefront of religious resurgence. Rooted in history, this revival has swept in on the tide of globalisation, fed by the inventiveness of the Chinese people.

> After decades of suppression during the Mao era, the number of followers of China’s five official religions – Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism – are steadily rising alongside a rich range of unofficial groups and alternative spiritual practices. It is a remarkable recovery, especially considering the destruction of religious infrastructure and knowledge, and continued political suppression.

Intimate photographs document the creativity of the faithful when creating ‘sacred space’ in a dense and restless urban environment.
