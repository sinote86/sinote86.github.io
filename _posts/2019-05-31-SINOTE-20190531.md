## 1989

> China was indeed experiencing a springtime. At last, its halting tradition of democratic activism and cosmopolitan aspiration seemed on the verge of triumphing over the rival traditions of imperial rule and Leninism. Here was definitive proof that ideas of freedom were not just a foreign import or imposition. For the first time since 1949, one could suddenly imagine a China that was both more democratic and more fully integrated into the outside world.

> But the moment didn’t last, as we know in marking this week’s melancholy 30th anniversary. Whatever the power of China’s long-suppressed democratic hopes, they could not withstand the ideological determination and brutal might of the Chinese Communist Party. The crushing of the Tiananmen protest movement was a shock not just to all those intoxicated, idealistic Chinese demonstrators but also to Westerners like myself who believed that, with our help, China was starting to find its way to being a more modern and open society.
>
> The tragedy of that possibly misplaced faith weighs especially heavily today. Under President Xi Jinping, a newly assertive authoritarian China now strikes many in the U.S. not just as a disappointment but as a threat. In retrospect, through the ups and downs of decades of diplomatic engagement and growing economic connection, the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989 now appears to be the moment when the regime most fully revealed the fundamental principles that now guide Mr. Xi and a rising China.

> These three factions – conservatives, reformers, and neo-authoritarian modernizers – were in a stalemate before the PLA’s tanks and troops entered the square. The massacre, the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year (by sheer coincidence), and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 changed that: only the neo-authoritarian option remained. While the political purge following the Tiananmen crackdown had decimated the liberals, the conservatives – demoralized and panicking after the fall of communism – could offer no viable survival strategy.
>
> And yet, while the stage had been cleared for the neo-authoritarians, by early 1992, when an 87-year-old Deng embarked on his historic tour of southern China in an effort to save the regime and redeem himself for the crackdown, the neo-authoritarians and the conservatives had merged. While no single label accurately describes the post-1989 order, its defining features were pragmatism, crony capitalism, and strategic restraint.
>
> Pragmatism, in particular, served the CPC well in the years after Tiananmen. At home, a flexible approach to policy allowed the regime to pursue pro-growth experiments, co-opt social elites, and respond to challenges to its authority, while Deng’s dictum to keep a “low profile” became the guiding principle of China’s foreign policy. The CPC continued to view the West as an existential ideological threat, which it countered by ceaselessly nurturing nationalist sentiment. But China’s leaders knew that they were free-riding on the liberal international order, and thus studiously avoided any real conflict with the United States.

> Dong Shengkun survived June 4, 1989, with his life, but with little else. 
>
> His decision to go to Tiananmen Square in the days and weeks leading up to the violent crackdown ended up costing him almost everything: his wife, his son, saying farewell to his father. It also cost him his job and any hope of a halfway decent job in the future. 
>
> But Dong, who is now 59 years old, says it was worth it.
>
> “Yes, I paid a price, but I have never regretted it for a moment,” he said in an interview in Beijing, where he still lives despite everything. “I feel so much more fortunate than those who lost their lives, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that our people know our history — not the history written by those in power, but the truth.” 
>
> Now, near the 30th anniversary of that bloody event in Tiananmen, Dong is doing his bit to counter the authorities’ efforts to erase the memory of those days in 1989, when hope and solidarity quickly turned into despair and then apathy.

> On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the crackdown, The Wall Street Journal spoke to a dozen survivors of the Tiananmen massacre, some living in China and some in the U.S. Three decades later, a number of survivors say that they feel a growing urgency to speak out as their generation ages and as Chinese leader Xi Jinping has tightened the reins on political expression. Others say it’s distressing to see how many Chinese have chosen to forget the idealism of 1989 and how many now seem to accept the idea that China has benefited in the long term because the government sent in the troops. Some survivors who went abroad have continued trying to speak out to varying degrees, but they have struggled to penetrate a country that has walled off sensitive material from its press, social media and internet access. Some who stayed at home acknowledge that they have reaped the benefits of a stable and prosperous, if politically repressive, China.

> Could they have done anything differently to avoid the massacre and preserve their movement? Part of the pain of Tiananmen, says Wang Chaohua, a student leader on the square who fled to Los Angeles in 1990, is how the Communist Party turned the events to its advantage. The government learned never again to let protests swell out of control. Stability became its watchword. The fact that China didn’t face more mass protests as it enacted economic reforms that deprived millions of their jobs and land is “entirely thanks to June Fourth,” says Ms. Wang, 66, who worked in a KFC franchise after arriving in the U.S. before eventually obtaining her doctorate in modern Chinese literature from UCLA.

> “Tank man” images are ruthlessly excised from Chinese social media, according to monitoring services. When the British journalist Louisa Lim was researching a 2015 book on the Tiananmen events and the suppression of their memory, she showed the iconic photo of “tank man” to 100 students at four universities in Beijing. Only 15 correctly identified it, two by guessing, she wrote in the “The People’s Republic of Amnesia.”

> Now the Chinese government is seeking to exert the same sort of control over how China’s history is seen in the rest of the world. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his allies describe the internet as an ideological battlefield where the Communist Party must prevail to expand China’s influence over international public opinion. His government has not only amped up controls on information inside China but sought to impose those standards on foreigners.
>
> Access to China’s official archives is increasingly restrictive, according to Chinese and foreign researchers, and when granted, the documents available are limited. Online databases run by Chinese academic institutions are eliminating articles seen as problematic by the government. Then there’s intimidation, with the government banning the books of Chinese academics and refusing visas to foreign scholars whose work it dislikes.

> After Tiananmen, however, liberal economists became targets of the state. Some were arrested; others were fired or resigned; several left the country. Those like Mr. Zhang who kept their jobs “couldn’t travel anywhere, and just went to work every day to study or do self-criticism,” he recalls. He went to the U.K. to study from 1990 to 1994.
>
> For three years, economic reforms stalled or regressed. Deng Xiaoping, then China’s paramount leader, kick-started them again in 1992, but the reforms shifted toward a more state-led model—wresting revenue and power back to Beijing, diverting rural labor to cities and making foreign trade and investment the top priorities.

> The post-1992 economic model is widely credited with lifting millions out of poverty and transforming China into the world’s second-largest economy. But for many who have studied the earlier period, or were directly involved in it, the short-lived 1980s reforms still represent an alternative path to more sustainable (albeit slower) growth and a healthier private sector. That earlier approach, they say, is especially relevant today as China confronts the fallout from three decades of unbridled state-led growth—including income inequality, environmental degradation, excessive government debt and persistent state-sector inefficiency.
