## Digital totalitarianism

[Made in China, Exported to the World: The Surveillance State](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/technology/ecuador-surveillance-cameras-police-government.html) <br> *by Paul Mozur, Jonah M. Kessel & Melissa Chan, from nytimes.com, 20190424*

>  The squat gray building in Ecuador’s capital commands a sweeping view of the city’s sparkling sprawl, from the high-rises at the base of the Andean valley to the pastel neighborhoods that spill up its mountainsides.
>
> The police who work inside are looking elsewhere. They spend their days poring over computer screens, watching footage that comes in from 4,300 cameras across the country.
>
> The high-powered cameras send what they see to 16 monitoring centers in Ecuador that employ more than 3,000 people. Armed with joysticks, the police control the cameras and scan the streets for drug deals, muggings and murders. If they spy something, they zoom in.
>
> This voyeur’s paradise is made with technology from what is fast becoming the global capital of surveillance: China.

[China’s unchecked expansion of data-powered AI raises civic concerns](https://www.ft.com/content/2237a15e-0219-11e9-bf0f-53b8511afd73) <br> *by Emily Feng, from ft.com, 20190425*

> Chinese citizens generate huge amounts of data, which is being used to fuel China’s big bet on artificial intelligence. But there are risks, and the [push towards AI](https://www.ft.com/content/fdeaf22a-c09a-11e8-95b1-d36dfef1b89a) has raised questions about how the Chinese state, as well as private companies, will collect, safeguard and utilise the trillions of data points collected every day.
>
> Beijing’s national artificial intelligence plan, implemented in 2017, provides a road map that predicts Chinese AI researchers leading an industry expected to be worth more than $150bn by 2030.
>
> Critics warn that the proliferation of AI technology-based applications could exacerbate a threat to civil liberties. 
>
> ...

> Sometimes, though, China’s AI capabilities fall short of the hype. Four years after the contentious social credit scheme was announced — intended to measure each citizen’s trustworthiness by assigning a universal score — only Beijing and Hangzhou have launched such scores. High scorers can unlock minor perks such as lower bus fares: not quite the Orwellian system predicted by China’s critics.

[Is This the End of Belt and Road, or Just the Beginning?](http://www.chinafile.com/conversation/end-of-belt-and-road-or-just-beginning) <br> *by A ChinaFile Conversation, from chinafile.com, 20190424*

> On April 25-27, China’s government will host the leaders of dozens of countries to celebrate the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the signature foreign policy program of Xi Jinping. Since its founding in October 2013, the BRI now covers more than 150 countries and encompasses billions of dollars of deals. In late March, Italy became the first G-7 nation to endorse Belt and Road.
>
> But meanwhile, there are signs that Beijing, and the rest of the world, are less than ecstatic about the BRI. In a February 2019 essay [entitled](https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Will-China-let-Belt-and-Road-die-quietly) “Will China Let Belt and Road Die Quietly?,” the scholar Minxin Pei writes that “In all likelihood, we will see a significant decline in the hype Chinese official media outlets devote to BRI. It is also a safe bet that Beijing’s funding for BRI will decline measurably this year—and in the coming years.”

[China Retools Vast Global Building Push Criticized as Bloated and Predatory](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/business/china-belt-and-road-infrastructure.html) <br>*by Jane Perlez, from nytimes.com, 20190425*

> Broadly facing criticism about overpriced and superfluous projects, China is reshaping and retooling its grand infrastructure plan, known as the Belt and Road Initiative. But Beijing isn’t retreating from its vision to build a network of ports, rails and roads that puts China at the center of global trade and enhances its geopolitical ambitions.
>
> Rather, China’s efforts are intended to present a friendlier face to global leaders, who are gathering this week in Beijing for a conference to mark the sixth year of the initiative. To show it’s a more responsible player, China is promising corruption-free, environmentally conscious ventures. It is also seeking advice from major multinational banks, asking other countries, such as Japan, to collaborate, and in some cases scaling back its projects.

[The Future of Shopping Is Already Happening in China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-24/china-s-gen-z-skips-the-stores-and-shops-on-social-media) <br> *by Daniela Wei & Shelly Banjo, from bloomberg.com, 20190424*

> When Shanghai university student Milky Guan buys cosmetics, she isn’t impressed by beauty stores and big name brands. Instead, the 20-year-old relies on a Chinese social media shopping website called [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/), or Little Red Book, to figure out what’s hot and what’s not. On Xiaohongshu—a startup that’s part e-commerce portal and part social media platform—Guan follows a popular online beauty influencer who teaches her fans how to apply makeup. During a recent livestream demonstration by the blogger, Guan snapped up four different cosmetic products within minutes—simply clicking on links embedded in the video.
>
> Guan is among the millions of shoppers born after 1996, known as Generation Z, who are starting to upend China’s sprawling retail industry. They’ve been raised on mobile devices, and social media isn’t just where they spend time—it’s where they spend cash.
>
> China’s Gen Z isn’t impressed by glitzy brand names and traditional advertising campaigns. Many are looking beyond the physical stores and e-commerce portals their predecessors preferred. They’re buying goods suggested by social media influencers known as *wanghong*. And they’re using messaging, short videos, livestreaming, and social media apps as gateways to making those purchases.
