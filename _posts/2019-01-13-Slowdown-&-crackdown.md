## Slowdown

[Clouds loom over global business as Chinese economy falters](https://www.ft.com/content/32576258-1651-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21) <br> *by Lucy Hornby & Chris Giles, from ft.com, 20190113*

> From VW to Apple, the Chinese economy is now the world’s business. No international brand can safely ignore China’s economic prospects. On a market exchange-rate basis, China accounted for 16 per cent of the global economy in 2018.
>
> But for global businesses, what matters more is growth. China’s rapid development and 1.4bn consumers have helped it to account for about 30 per cent of worldwide growth for the past decade even as its domestic expansion has slowed.

> If the Chinese consumer decides to hold back, companies around the world will tremble...

> A slowing economy is putting pressure on jobs in China (though Apple’s woes may involve other factors, too—see [article](https://www.economist.com/node/21756851)). The official unemployment rate is stable at around 5%, but as always this figure is a poor guide. Surveys in the manufacturing and service sectors show that companies have been cutting staff since at least September. Wage growth is tepid compared with the sizzling norm of a few years ago. In November profits at industrial firms fell for the first time in nearly three years.

> When China’s leaders met in December to map out economic policy for 2019, they said their priority would be to stabilise employment. They are anxious about social stability in a year studded with sensitive anniversaries. Among them will be the 30th of the Tiananmen protests, which involved economic grievances as well as political ones. Suppression of labour unrest has become even harsher in recent months. In one case, police detained more than 30 students and activists who had tried to help workers organise a union at a firm in the southern city of Shenzhen.

## Crackdown

[In China, they’re closing churches, jailing pastors – and even rewriting scripture](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/13/china-christians-religious-persecution-translation-bible) <br> *by Lily Kuo, from theguardian.com, 20190113*

> Researchers say the current drive, fuelled by government unease over the growing number of Christians and their potential links to the west, is aimed not so much at destroying Christianity but bringing it to heel.

> As of 2018, the government has implemented sweeping rules on religious practices, adding more requirements for religious groups and barring unapproved organisations from engaging in any religious activity. But the campaign is not just about managing behaviour. One of the goals of a government work plan for “promoting Chinese Christianity” between 2018 and 2022 is “thought reform”. The plan calls for “retranslating and annotating” the Bible, to find commonalities with socialism and establish a “correct understanding” of the text.

[Why 1984 Isn't Banned in China](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/why-1984-and-animal-farm-arent-banned-china/580156/) <br> *by Amy Hawkins & Jeffrey Wasserstrom, from theatlantic.com, 20190113*

> The assumption is not that Chinese people can’t figure out the meaning of 1984, but that the small number of people who will bother to read it won’t pose much of a threat.
>
> At an elite level, the rules in China have always been and still are more relaxed. When the first simplified character Chinese translation of 1984 was published in 1979, it was kept in a special section of libraries and bookstores that was off limits to most people. The laobaixing—the “common people”—couldn’t get their hands on the book until 1985. Today, graduate students can have much more nuanced and frank discussions about controversial periods in Chinese history than even college undergraduates.

> There are three basic reasons for these disparities: elites must by definition have skin in the game in relation to the ruling party; the government knows it can’t really stop well-connected, highly educated citizens from acquiring the information they want, in part because they’re able to travel abroad and expose themselves to a variety of materials there; and the authorities are aware that a touch of liberty is often better than a boot in the face to keep people in line.
