## China-US

[Is Trump’s Trade War with China a Civilizational Conflict?](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-race-war-against-china-by-minxin-pei-2019-05) <br> *by Minxin Pei, from project-syndicate.org, 20190514*

> Most commentators see the US-China conflict as a struggle between an incumbent power and its most plausible challenger. The two countries appear to be falling into the proverbial “Thucydides Trap,” a self-fulfilling prophecy in which a hegemon’s fear of being supplanted leads it to act in such a way as to precipitate a war for global dominance.
>
> And yet, even if today’s conflict is being driven by a zero-sum quest for power, that should not be the US’s sole consideration. Given the threat of civilizational collapse posed by climate change, the Trump administration’s focus only on US interests appears selfish and irresponsible to the rest of the world.
>
> The fact is that most of the world – including a sizable share of Americans – has no interest in being plunged into another cold war just to preserve US hegemony. If the US government wants to garner international support for countering Chinese power and influence, it must make a more compelling case.

> The Chinese government has struck a defiant tone since President Trump ratcheted up the trade war on Friday [by raising tariffs on Chinese exports](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/business/china-tariffs-list.html?module=inline) worth $200 billion a year. “If the U.S. wants to talk, our door is open,” said a commentary on state-controlled China Central Television on Monday night that quickly went viral. “If the U.S. wants to fight, we’ll be with them till the end.”

> Many entrepreneurs and intellectuals, by contrast, are hoping for a deal. China’s rise out of the stark terror of the Cultural Revolution was fueled in part from connections to the United States, [an early diplomatic partner](https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/feb-17-1972-president-nixon-departs-for-diplomatic-trip-to-china/) that offered [investment](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/19/business/ford-said-to-be-planning-assembly-plant-in-china.html?module=inline), markets and opportunity. There’s even a word going around the Chinese internet for the tight economic bonds that have formed between the world’s two largest economies: “Chimerica.”

## Slowdown

[How foreign groups fare in China’s slowing two-track economy](https://www.ft.com/content/c4001b5a-43d8-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3) <br> *by Gabriel Wildau & David Blood, from ft.com, 20190514*

> Foreign companies operating or selling in China bucked the country’s slowdown trend last year, even as the world’s second-largest economy appears to have decelerated more than official figures suggest.
>
> China’s biggest economic slowdown in three decades is provoking angst among companies that have become used to its booming economic expansion. The pain is not evenly spread, however, as a Financial Times data analysis shows.
>
> Overall, the revenues of 2,891 foreign non-financial companies grew 19.8 per cent last year, compared with 13.9 per cent in 2017, according to data from financial intelligence provider FactSet. Within this group, 54 per cent of companies posted faster growth rates in 2018 compared with 2017, counterbalancing the deceleration or outright revenue decline of the rest.

> To many, it may seem somewhat strange that Ms Tao has any worries at all. She and her husband have a joint annual income of Rmb500,000 ($72,700), putting them very easily in the top 10 per cent of earners in China.

>
> But Ms Tao still feels far from secure. She considers her household barely middle class. She and her husband save some Rmb10,000-Rmb20,000 per month, but her aim of buying a house feels distant. She wonders whether she’ll be lucky enough to get her daughter, Juanjuan, into a primary school that stands a chance of placing her in a good lower-secondary school, which means better odds of a good upper-secondary and university education.

> Ms Tao’s situation is partly the consequence of structural shifts in China’s economy and society that have been forming over the past three decades, since privatisation started in earnest. The insecurity of the middle classes is described by Chinese commentators as arising from growing inequality coupled with falling social mobility — known as “class solidification”.

## Xinjiang

[Islamophobia in China](http://www.chinafile.com/conversation/islamophobia-china) <br> *by A ChinaFile Conversation, from chinafile.com, 20190514*

> Roughly 20 million Muslims live in China today; many of them live in the northwest region of Xinjiang, where the government is incarcerating an [estimated](http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/where-did-one-million-figure-detentions-xinjiangs-camps-come) one million Uighur Muslims. In recent weeks, news reports have emerged of the [razing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/07/revealed-new-evidence-of-chinas-mission-to-raze-the-mosques-of-xinjiang) of mosques and other religious buildings across the region. In March, when 50 people were [massacred](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/newzealand-shooter-03182019143130.html) at two mosques in New Zealand, many Chinese people [voiced](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/weibo-new-zealand-massacre.php) support for the shooter—in the words of one commentator—for his “heroic revenge.” What are the roots of popular fear of Islam in China today, and how is it connected to the actions of the Chinese government in Xinjiang? —*The Editors*
