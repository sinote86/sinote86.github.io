[‘I felt like a slave:’ Inside China’s complex system of incarceration and control of minorities](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-i-felt-like-a-slave-inside-chinas-complex-system-of-incarceration/) <br> *by Nathan VanderKlippe, from theglobeandmail.com, 20190401*

> Chinese authorities have kept Xinjiang’s detention centres shrouded in secrecy, refusing to provide statistics on the number of people they contain or to open them to visitors, save on choreographed official tours (on one earlier this year, detainees sang *If You’re Happy and You Know It*, in English.) Last year, police threatened a Globe reporter with arrest for approaching one such facility, and forcibly deleted photographs of its exterior.
>
> Yet through satellite imagery, government procurement documents, accounts from previous detainees and testimony from overseas relatives of people living in Xinjiang, the international community has gained an increasingly comprehensive understanding of what is taking place in Xinjiang.

> In the Kazakhstan city of Almaty, The Globe spoke with seven people, including Ms. Auelhan, who have spent time in indoctrination and detention centres in Xinjiang.
>
> Each account differs, in the locations where detainees were held, in the length of their detention and in the treatment they sustained. In aggregate, though, they help to trace the outlines of an extensive system that has taken shape in Xinjiang, one that employs a wide range of restrictions on personal freedoms and a complicated array of different types of facilities.

[Chinese Dissidents Feel Heat of Beijing’s Wrath. Even in Canada.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/world/canada/china-dissident-harassment-sheng-xue.html) <br> *by Catherine Porter, from nytimes.com, 20190401*

> As China extends its influence around the globe, it has mastered the art of soft power, [establishing Confucius Institutes](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/us/critics-worry-about-influence-of-chinese-institutes-on-us-campuses.html?module=inline) on Western college campuses and [funding  ports and power plants](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/18/world/asia/world-built-by-china.html?module=inline) in developing countries.

> But building up is only one prong of the Chinese strategy. The other is knocking down. And few know this better than Sheng Xue.

> For more than six years, the Chinese-Canadian activist has been the victim of a relentless campaign of discreditation by blog, Listserv, e-book and social media, which experts say bears the markings of a coordinated attack by the Chinese Communist Party.

[Winter Settles on Chinese Universities](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/01/winter-settles-on-chinese-universities/) <br> *by Sarah Biddulph, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190401*

> Last week, Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Beijing’s Tsinghua University who in recent months has written a series of essays critical of policies of the Chinese Communist Party and of its current leader, Xi Jinping, was banned from teaching, relieved of his academic duties, and put under investigation. While Xu has not technically been fired, many fear this week’s actions may be a prelude to more severe moves to silence a witty and prominent political critic and further chill an already wintry environment for scholarship and free expression in China. We asked contributors for their thoughts on the significance of Xu’s suspension and its possible consequences for political and intellectual life in China. —*The Editors*

[After China’s deadly chemical disaster, a shattered region weighs cost of the rush to ‘get rich’](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/after-chinas-deadly-chemical-disaster-a-shattered-region-weighs-cost-of-the-rush-to-get-rich/2019/03/31/78cf3a5c-508b-11e9-bdb7-44f948cc0605_story.html) <br> *by Gerry Shih, from washingtonpost.com, 20190401*

> To the residents of Xiangshui county, about 200 miles north of Shanghai, the Tianjiayi explosion on March 21 wasn’t so much an accident as an inevitability.
>
> Over the past two decades, local officials have transformed this once-overlooked coastal expanse of wheat and rice farms into one of China’s major chemical-production centers, tripling the region’s economic output in the process.
>
> But the reckless search for economic salvation condemned the community instead. The toll, locals say, has been polluted rivers, toxic soil, four major explosions in 12 years and a litany of smaller accidents that turned the terrifying into the routine.
>
> Three years after a similar blast in Tianjin killed more than 170 people southeast of Beijing, the Xiangshui disaster is a reminder of the domestic challenges facing President Xi Jinping, who has vowed to pursue safe, “high-quality” development but also keep the sagging economy and employment numbers afloat.

[Can the world quench China’s bottomless thirst for milk?](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/29/can-the-world-quench-chinas-bottomless-thirst-for-milk) <br> *by Felicity Lawrence, from theguardian.com, 20190329*

> When the People’s Republic of China was born in 1949, its national dairy herd was said to consist of a mere 120,000 cows. Yet today, China is the third-largest milk producer in the world, estimated to have around 13m dairy cows, and the average person has gone from barely drinking milk at all to consuming about 30kg of dairy produce a year.
>
> In a little over 30 years, milk has become the emblem of a modern, affluent society and a country able to feed its people. The transition has been driven by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), for which milk is not just food, but a key strategic tool. The party’s claim to a monopoly on power is based on the principles of socialism. As it has [tempered that socialist ideology](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/06/human-impulses-run-riot-chinas-shocking-pace-of-change) with elements of a market economy, the legitimacy of the one-party state has instead depended on delivering the capitalist promise of increasing material wealth. The fact that people can afford animal produce is a visible symbol of the party’s success. Making animal produce, particularly milk, available to everyone across the country is a way of tackling potentially destabilising inequalities that have arisen as China has developed between the big cities and some of the poorest rural areas. In the poorest regions, nearly one in five children are still stunted, or short for their age, from lack of adequate nutrition.

> The reinvention of milk as a staple of modern China has required a series of remarkable feats, not least of which was to overcome the people’s lactose-intolerance and create a market for milk where there had been none. It has involved privatising farming, allowing processing companies to become corporations, and even converting desert areas into giant factory farms.
>
> Now the global impact of China’s ever-expanding dairy sector is causing concern in other countries. Dairy farming requires access to vast quantities of fresh water: it takes an estimated 1,020 litres of water to make one litre of milk. But China suffers from water scarcity, and has been buying land and water rights abroad, as well as establishing large-scale processing factories in other countries.
