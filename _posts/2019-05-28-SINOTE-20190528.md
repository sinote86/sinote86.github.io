[30 Years After Tiananmen, a Chinese Military Insider Warns: Never Forget](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/world/asia/china-tiananmen-square-massacre.html) <br> *by Chris Buckley, from nytimes.com, 20190528*

> For three decades, Jiang Lin kept quiet about the carnage she had seen on the night when the Chinese Army rolled through Beijing to [crush student protests in Tiananmen Square](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/world/crackdown-beijing-troops-attack-crush-beijing-protest-thousands-fight-back.html?module=inline). But the memories tormented her — of soldiers firing into crowds in the dark, bodies slumped in pools of blood and the thud of clubs when troops bludgeoned her to the ground near the square.
>
> Ms. Jiang was a lieutenant in the People’s Liberation Army back then, with a firsthand view of both the massacre and a failed attempt by senior commanders to dissuade China’s leaders from using military force to crush the pro-democracy protests. Afterward, as the authorities sent protesters to prison and wiped out memories of the killing, she said nothing, but her conscience ate at her.
>
> Now, in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown, Ms. Jiang, 66, has decided for the first time to tell her story. She said she felt compelled to call for a public reckoning because generations of Chinese Communist Party leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have expressed no remorse for the violence. Ms. Jiang left China this week.

[Chaos, hope, change: stories from 70 years of the People's Republic of China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/29/chaos-hope-change-stories-from-70-years-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china) <br> *by Lily Kuo, from theguardian.com, 20190529*

> This year marks 70 years since Mao Zedong stood in Tiananmen Square in Beijing and declared the beginning of the People’s Republic of China. To the outside world, China’s transformation from a poor agrarian society into one of the world’s most powerful economies is nothing short of miraculous.
>
> “If you think about what China was 70 years ago, essentially a country that had fought its way through two wars and was on its knees and battered – the idea that in 70 years it would be the second biggest economy in the world… and a major global player would have seemed very unlikely indeed,” said Rana Mitter, a professor of history and politics of modern China at Oxford University.
>
> But for those who lived through these years, the pace of change has been [dizzying and at times jolting](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/06/human-impulses-run-riot-chinas-shocking-pace-of-change). Almost no other country has experienced shifts as dramatic as China has – almost as if each generation has lived in an entirely different country.

[The Trade War’s Next Battle Could Be China’s Access to Wall Street](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/business/alibaba-trade-war-wall-street.html) <br> *by Keith Bradsher & Ana Swanson, from nytimes.com, 20190528*

> Some trade experts and others urging the Trump administration to keep a hawkish stance are discussing whether the White House should curb China’s access to Wall Street. Chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through American financial markets in recent years.
>
> Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, said there were continuing efforts inside and outside the administration to rethink China’s role in American stock markets, in part because of a lack of transparency about the ultimate owners of Chinese companies.
>
> ...
>
> Adding fuel to the discussion, Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that held a [hugely successful initial public offering](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/alibaba-raises-21-8-billion-in-initial-public-offering/) in New York five years ago, is now considering also listing its shares in the semiautonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were not public, said the move was not under consideration because of geopolitical worries.

> As the United States ramps up other barriers to trade, the outlook for the financial sector on both sides of the Pacific is starting to change, part of a broader decoupling between the two economies.

[Food Delivery Apps Are Drowning China in Plastic](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/china-food-delivery-trash.html) <br> *by Raymond Zhong & Carolyn Zhang, from nytimes.com, 20190528*

> In all likelihood, the enduring physical legacy of China’s internet boom will not be the glass-and-steel office complexes or the fancy apartments for tech elites.
>
> It will be the plastic.
>
> The astronomical growth of food delivery apps in China is flooding the country with takeout containers, utensils and bags. And the country’s patchy recycling system isn’t keeping up. The vast majority of this plastic ends up discarded, buried or burned with the rest of the trash, researchers and recyclers say.
