[U.S. Restrictions on Huawei Expose a High-Tech Achilles’ Heel for China](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/technology/huawei-china-us-trade.html) <br> *by Raymond Zhong, from nytimes.com, 20190521*

> For all of China’s efforts to become a global force in high technology rivaling the United States, it has mostly failed to produce top-flight contenders in one crucial area: the industry that gave Silicon Valley its name. 
>
> Last year, China imported more than $300 billion worth of computer chips, the backbone of all digital products. That is more than it spent on crude oil from abroad. 
>
> Washington has now turned China’s reliance on American microchips against Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that the Trump administration has labeled a national security threat. The Commerce Department last week [restricted American firms](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/technology/huawei-ban-president-trump.html?module=inline) from selling components and technology to the company, essentially cutting Huawei off from Google software, Qualcomm chips and more.

[As the trade war heats up, China looks to Japan’s past for lessons](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/05/21/as-the-trade-war-heats-up-china-looks-to-japans-past-for-lessons) <br> *from economist.com, 20190521*

> As the International Monetary Fund has argued, there were at least two other factors that could have led to a different outcome. Excessive stimulus, by itself, did not guarantee that Japan would suffer an asset bubble. It was that much more dangerous when combined with financial deregulation, which led banks to lend more to property developers and homebuyers. And the bursting of the bubble did not guarantee that Japan would suffer a lost decade, let alone three. A sluggish response by regulators compounded the trouble. Rather than pushing banks to raise capital, they encouraged them to go on lending to zombie firms.
>
> So the simplistic story—that the Plaza Accord felled Japan—misses the mark. Rather, China should draw two lessons from Japan’s experience of trade tensions with America. First, it must get its domestic policy response right. Japan feared that the deal with America would cause its growth to suffer; China fears the same about the absence of a deal. But the bigger dangers for Japan were over-stimulus and flawed regulation. China seems to grasp that. So far it has been cautious about pumping up growth. The real test will come if the trade war continues to escalate.
>
> A second lesson is the danger of resisting America’s demands, just because it is America that is making them. Had Japan acted on some of America’s long-standing gripes, it might have fared better in the 1990s. Domestic competition would have been stronger. A bigger role for foreign investors might have prompted Japanese banks to tackle their festering problems. Similarly, it is China, not America, that would be the biggest beneficiary if it moves more quickly to open its economy to foreign firms.

[China Deserves Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/opinion/china-trump-trade.html) <br> *by Thomas L. Friedman, from nytimes.com, 20190521*

> Trump’s instinct that America needs to rebalance its trade relationship with Beijing — before China gets too big to compromise — is correct. And it took a human wrecking ball like Trump to get China’s attention. But now that we have it, both countries need to recognize just how pivotal this moment is.
>
> The original U.S.-China opening back in the 1970s defined our restored trade ties, which were limited. When we let China join the World Trade Organization in 2001, it propelled China into a trading powerhouse under rules that still gave China lots of concessions as a developing economy.
>
> This new negotiation will define how the U.S. and China relate as economic peers, competing for the same 21st-century industries, at a time when our markets are totally intertwined. *So this is no ordinary trade dispute. This is the big one.*

[The US-China conflict challenges the world](https://www.ft.com/content/870c895c-7b11-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560) <br> *by Martin Wolf, from ft.com, 20190521*

> Where does deepening economic conflict between the US and China leave the rest of the world, especially historic allies of the US? In normal circumstances, the latter would stand beside it. The EU, after all, shares many of its [concerns](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/news/eu-china-strategic-outlook-2019-mar-12_en) about Chinese behaviour. Yet these are not normal circumstances. Under Donald Trump, the US has become a rogue superpower, hostile, among many other things, to the fundamental norms of a trading system based on multilateral agreement and binding rules. Indeed, US allies, too, are a target of the wave of [bilateral bullying](https://www.ft.com/content/9aca49e0-78a3-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab).
>
> So what are American allies to do as the US and China battle? This is not just about Mr Trump. His focus on bilateral trade balances may even be relatively manageable. Worse, a large proportion of Americans shares a [deepening hostility](https://www.pewglobal.org/2018/08/28/as-trade-tensions-rise-fewer-americans-see-china-favorably/) not just to China’s behaviour, but to the fact of a rising China.

[Inside Huawei – a photo essay](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/21/inside-huawei-a-photo-essay) <br> *by Kevin Frayer, from theguardian.com, 20190521*

> Known as China’s Silicon Valley, Shenzhen is a sprawling collection of the country’s most influential technology brands. At the heart of it is Huawei, an industry behemoth that is deeply revered in China and widely scrutinised in the west.
>
> The company’s facilities in Shenzhen and nearby Dongguan are massive, even by Chinese standards. Tens of thousands of Huawei employees work between three bases, including a new research and development campus with European-styled buildings designed as a nod to the company founder’s training as an architect.

> It is easy to be overwhelmed by the size of it but I was more interested in getting a small glimpse of the real culture of the company. We all have an idea of what we expect a tech giant to look like on the inside, but Huawei was a mystery to me as it was only recently that the company began to invite western journalists to visit.
