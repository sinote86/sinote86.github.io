[The road not taken: China after Tiananmen](https://www.ft.com/content/3867e336-7bc1-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560) <br> *by James Kynge, from ft.com, 20190524*

> I covered Tiananmen Square as a young Reuters journalist. Trying to trace its legacy is like attempting to count the number of bends along the winding course of the Yellow River; so much of what China is today — and how it is seen in the world — derives from the brutality of a crackdown that smothered the hopes of a generation.
>
> My job in those days was to spend days and nights in the square interviewing the protest leaders and phoning back quotations to our news bureau. The mobile phone I was issued with was the size of a brick and it cost several thousand dollars. As he handed it to me, my bureau chief said: “If you lose this, we will lose you.” So when I slept on the steps of the Monument to the People’s Heroes in the centre of the square, I would wrap the phone in my shirt and put it in my cloth bag to make a burglar-proof pillow.
>
> The mood was that of a festival of youth. Although the common description of the Tiananmen demonstrations in the western media is that they were “pro-democracy”, the reality was much more complex. Romance and sex reinforced a sense of ideological experiment, while the makeshift tents in the square afforded more privacy than university dormitories that often housed eight to a room.

## China-US

[Huawei v the US: Trump risks a tech cold war](https://www.ft.com/content/78ffbf36-7e0a-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560) <br> *by Richard Waters, Kathrin Hille & Louise Lucas, from ft.com, 20190524*

> President Donald Trump’s latest confrontation with China’s most important tech company may just have plunged the world into a technology cold war. 
>
> Efforts to limit the ability of Huawei to buy from suppliers reliant on American technology threaten to tie the hands of a company that aimed to become a key global supplier in the era of [5G mobile communications](https://www.ft.com/content/9cff7384-6bf1-11e9-a9a5-351eeaef6d84).
>
> China’s control of information within its borders, through restrictions on access to the global internet, had already put it in a separate digital universe to much of the rest of the world. Now, by cutting off Huawei, the US has taken a retaliatory step that points towards a near-total tech split. 
>
> But if this turns out to be a defining moment in Washington’s efforts to [isolate an economic and political adversary](https://www.ft.com/content/7c96e4a0-7886-11e9-bbad-7c18c0ea0201), it has touched off an uncomfortable reaction in the [global tech industry, ](https://www.ft.com/content/f31ccb8c-7cad-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560)which now finds itself on the frontline of a conflict that looks profoundly bad for business.

[Huawei’s Yearslong Rise Is Littered With Accusations of Theft and Dubious Ethics](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huaweis-yearslong-rise-is-littered-with-accusations-of-theft-and-dubious-ethics-11558756858) <br> *by Chuin-Wei Yap, Dan Strumpf, Dustin Volz, Kate O’Keeffe & Aruna Viswanatha, from wsj.com, 20190524*

> Huawei has since grown from a little-known interloper into China’s global tech champion, the world’s biggest maker of telecoms gear, [a leader in next-generation 5G networks,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-revenue-jumps-as-5g-contracts-roll-in-11555904631?mod=article_inline) and a[ significant source of friction between the world’s biggest powers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-internet-divided-between-the-u-s-and-china-has-become-a-battleground-11549688420?mod=article_inline). The company, which employs 188,000 people in more than 170 countries, sells smartphones—more than Apple Inc. —provides cloud services, makes microchips and runs undersea cables that ferry global internet traffic.
>
> Along the way, Huawei has been dogged by allegations that its gains came on the back of copying and theft. A review of 10 cases in U.S. federal courts, and dozens of interviews with U.S. officials, former employees, competitors, and collaborators suggest Huawei had a corporate culture that blurred the boundary between competitive achievement and ethically dubious methods of pursuing it.
>
> Huawei’s accusers describe a wide-ranging, brazen, and opportunistic appetite: the targets of the alleged thefts range from longtime tech peers, including Cisco Technology Inc., and T-Mobile US Inc., to a musician in Seattle barely making minimum wage in his day job. In one case, a [relative of Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei who worked at Motorola Inc. is alleged to have brought secret details of the U.S. company’s technology to a meeting in Beijing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704684604575381362665259760?mod=article_inline). Another suit alleges complicity by Huawei deputy chairman Eric Xu in secrets theft.

[China’s Supply of Minerals for iPhones and Missiles Could Be a Risky Trade Weapon](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/business/china-us-trade-war-rare-earths.html) <br> *by Keith Bradsher, from nytimes.com, 20190523*

> China’s command of the rare-earth market could give Beijing a way to strike back at Mr. Trump as he raises tariffs and deprives Chinese companies of the technology they need to survive. A [similar move by China nine years ago, against Japan](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/business/global/24rare.html?module=inline) over a territorial dispute, shocked manufacturers around the world, sent prices soaring and revealed Beijing’s control of an essential part of the global supply chain.
>
> This time, however, the impact of any block on rare earths may be far less clear cut. It could undermine China’s reputation as a manufacturing hub. Other trading partners, notably Japan and South Korea, could become collateral damage. And in an odd turnabout, China’s own needs have made it somewhat dependent on ore from the United States.

[US companies reshape supply chains after China ultimatum](https://www.ft.com/content/bb3a3546-7c31-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560) <br> *by James Politi, Sue-Lin Wong & Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, from ft.com, 20190523*

> US companies have gradually reduced their dependence on Chinese imports in recent years as production costs, from labour to transportation, have increased compared with neighbouring Asian countries. American footwear businesses used to bring in more than 90 per cent of their products from China a decade ago, but that has decreased to 69 per cent. 
>
> But they are now being forced to contemplate a much more abrupt change to avoid bearing the brunt of [massive tariffs](https://www.ft.com/content/3bbc7690-7c44-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560) that would force them to raise prices for consumers, or, in the worst case, slash employment.

[Amid trade tensions with America, China is showing old war films](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/05/25/amid-trade-tensions-with-america-china-is-showing-old-war-films) <br> *from economist.com, 20190523*

> China’s noisiest patriots, vowing on social media to ditch iPhones for Chinese smartphones, have no idea of the true price their country paid in Korea. They know nothing, for that matter, about why America sought peace talks almost 70 years ago. True, America was daunted by China’s willingness to sacrifice lives. In the end, though, America and its allies wanted an armistice because a unified Korea was not an interest worth all-out war, let alone a nuclear one as some hothead generals proposed.
>
> Today, America is debating something unrelated: whether openness to a rising China is sensible and even necessary, or an act of self-harm. War talk and broadcasting xenophobic films is a gift to American hawks who argue that China is an ideological foe that cannot be trusted. In their desperation to assure their own people that they are not a pushover, China’s rulers are forgetting the first lesson of propaganda. Real history can be a valuable guide. Falsified history leads countries astray.
