## Hong Kong

[China wants Hong Kong’s loyalty and love. What it’s getting: Distrust and disdain.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/what-china-struggles-more-than-ever-to-get-from-hong-kong-loyalty-and-love/2019/06/17/13b55b9e-8f6d-11e9-b6f4-033356502dce_story.html) <br> *by Gerry Shih, from washingtonpost.com, 20190617*

> Historic numbers of protesters in Hong Kong’s streets and a political crisis engulfing its leader, Carrie Lam, in the past week have highlighted an enduring conundrum faced by Xi: For decades, Beijing has asked the former British colony for loyalty, if not love. Time and again, its people have responded with distrust, if not loathing.
>
> Twenty-two years after regaining control over Hong Kong following more than 150 years of British rule, the Beijing government’s efforts to win over residents’ hearts and minds appear to be stumbling, raising doubts about not only Xi’s long-term strategy for Hong Kong but also his overtures to Taiwan, the island he seeks to absorb.

> They are on the front lines of every demonstration, dressed in black T-shirts and pumping their fists as they march through Hong Kong’s sweltering streets. They organize on encrypted messaging groups and hand out helmets and goggles at rallies.

> Hong Kong’s youth are at the forefront of protests this month that have thrown the city into a political crisis, including a vast rally on Sunday that was perhaps the largest in its history. Organizers contend that close to two million of the territory’s seven million people participated, calling on the government to withdraw proposed legislation that would allow extraditions to mainland China.

> For the many high school and university-age students who flooded the streets, the issue is much bigger than extradition alone. As they see it, they are fighting a “final battle” for some semblance of autonomy from the Chinese government.

> They came to show their opposition to a proposed law that would extend the reach of China’s judiciary into Hong Kong among other demands, capping a week of protests that have [convulsed this city of around 7.4 million](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-upheaval-puts-beijing-in-a-bind-11560733232?mod=article_inline).

[Why These Hong Kong Protests Are Different](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/06/hong-kongs-protests-leader/591820/) <br> *by Timothy McLaughlin, from theatlantic.com, 20190617*

> Hong Kong’s recent protests have drawn comparisons to the 2014 Umbrella Movement demonstrations, which saw young protesters occupy thoroughfares for 79 days to call for universal suffrage for Hong Kong. There are, however, significant differences, perhaps the most obvious of them being the lack of a clear leader. Five years ago, Joshua Wong, just a teenager at the time, rose to be the central figure of the movement. *Time* magazine put him on its [cover](https://time.com/3482556/hong-kong-protest-teenagers/), and the *Financial Times* called him “the teen doing battle with Beijing.” Wong was released Monday morning after serving nearly five weeks in jail on charges stemming from his involvement in the 2014 protests. Moments after being escorted from jail, he [called](https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-leaves-jail-vows-join-protests-doc-1hk81m2) for Lam to step down and the extradition bill to be withdrawn.
>
> No single person has risen to Wong’s status this time around, but the Civil Human Rights Front—a coalition of 50 organizations, including pro-democracy political parties—has been instrumental in building and helping sustain the protest movement, and in the process has obtained remarkable results, even if incomplete by its own measure.

> Any resignation by Mrs. Lam would prompt strong demands by democracy activists for her successor to be chosen in free and open elections. But the Communist Party leadership in Beijing, loath to allow any steps that might jeopardize one-party control on the mainland, is unlikely to let them be held.

> The political sensitivities over the events in Hong Kong were evident as the Chinese authorities worked around the clock to keep most of the mainland in the dark about the demonstrations.
