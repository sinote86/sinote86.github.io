## China-US

[Donald Trump risks political backlash as deal grows more likely](https://www.ft.com/content/491d75ea-38c5-11e9-b856-5404d3811663) <br> *by James Politi & Lucy Hornby, from ft.com, 20190225*

> Both he and Mr Xi have invested time, energy and political capital into a series of talks over the past two months from which it will be difficult to walk away without an agreement. “At this point, I think both sides want a deal,” said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think-tank. “I expect they will sign something soon.”
>
> Yet even if a deal is more likely than not, there is reason to doubt whether it will be as comprehensive as Mr Trump is likely to depict — or even if it can deliver a lasting commercial peace between Washington and Beijing.

> The point is that when it comes to dealing with Trump and his team, autocracies have an advantage over democracies that follow the rule of law. And trade disputes are arguably the least of it.

> So while stock markets are happy about the prospects for trade peace with China, the broader picture is deeply disturbing. If we do manage to limit the damage from this confrontation, it will be for the wrong reasons. And the warped motivations governing U.S. foreign policy may yet have deeply destructive consequences, with a trade war far from being the scariest possibility.

> For years, officials in Washington — which is legally bound to defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression — viewed Tsai with skepticism, if not outright concern.

> Now, the political calculus may be shifting at a time when the United States is stepping up its global competition against Beijing.

> Taiwanese voters will have to choose between continuing with Tsai or backing one of several contenders from the Kuomintang opposition party, which seeks a detente with Beijing.

> Since electing Tsai in 2016, the island of 24 million people has been caught in the vise of a Chinese economic and diplomatic pressure campaign designed to punish Tsai’s party.

## Sharp power

[China’s Latin American ambitions on display in Chile](https://www.ft.com/content/78a4936e-28b9-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7) <br> *by Benedict Mander, from ft.com, 20190225*

> While Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy, remains the biggest prize, China is increasingly focused on making inroads in the region through countries such as Chile, whose fast-growing economy, stable government and natural resources such as lithium — a key component in batteries that power everything from smartphones to electric cars — make it an attractive target for China’s efforts to expand its global reach.
>
> But China’s Latin American ambitions — coming as the US takes a step back from a region it once dubbed its “backyard” — have drawn criticism from those who fear Beijing is trying to expand its geopolitical dominance, leaving partner countries with big debts. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president, for instance, has complained that China is “buying Brazil”.

[Turkey steps up criticism of China over crackdown on Uighurs](https://www.ft.com/content/3eecab22-3915-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0) <br> *by Laura Pitel, from ft.com, 20190225*

> Mr Cavusoglu’s remarks on Monday, which come as international criticism of China’s treatment of the Uighurs is growing, mark the first time a senior Turkish minister has spoken out publicly on the issue. He said Turkey felt “concern” about recent reports on racial discrimination and human rights violations against Uighurs and other Muslim communities in Xinjiang. 
>
> Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, has long taken pride in casting Ankara as a defender of the world’s oppressed Muslims, from the Palestinians to Myanmar’s Rohingya minority. But amid mounting reports about Uighur oppression, government critics have accused Mr Erdogan of staying silent for fear of damaging its relationship with a leading global power.

[2019 Is a Sensitive Year for China. Xi Is Nervous.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/world/asia/china-xi-warnings.html) <br> *by Chris Buckley, from nytimes.com, 20190225*

> China’s leader, Xi Jinping, abruptly summoned hundreds of officials to Beijing recently, forcing some to reschedule long-planned local assemblies. The meeting seemed orchestrated to convey anxious urgency. The Communist Party, Mr. Xi told the officials, faces major risks on all fronts and must batten down the hatches.

> The speech was one of Mr. Xi’s starkest warnings since he came to power in 2012, and has been echoed at hundreds of local party meetings nationwide.
>
> It underscores how slowing growth and China’s grinding trade fight with the United States have magnified the party leadership’s chronic fears of social unrest. Trade talks in Washington between American and Chinese officials ended last week without an official agreement, although President Trump delayed a deadline to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, saying that negotiators were making progress.

> There are no political challengers on the horizon who could pose an immediate threat to the Communist Party or Mr. Xi. But his remarks made clear that especially in 2019 — a year of politically sensitive anniversaries — the party would aggressively extinguish sparks that could ignite protests and turbulence.
