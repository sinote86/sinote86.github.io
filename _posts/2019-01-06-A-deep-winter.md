## Beyond Xinjiang

[China Targets Prominent Uighur Intellectuals to Erase an Ethnic Identity](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighur-intellectuals.html) <br> *by Austin Ramzy, from nytimes.com, 20190105*

> The mass detention of some of China’s most accomplished Uighurs has become an alarming symbol of the Communist Party’s most intense social-engineering drive in decades, according to scholars, human rights advocates and exiled Uighurs.
>
> As the guardians of Uighur traditions, chroniclers of their history and creators of their art, the intellectuals were building the Central Asian, Turkic-speaking society’s reservoir of collective memory within the narrow limits of authoritarian rule. Their detention underscores the party’s attempts to decimate Uighur identity in order to remold the group into a people who are largely secular, integrated into mainstream Chinese culture and compliant with the Communist Party, observers say.

> Today, though, the intensity of the anti-Islamic campaign in Xinjiang has resulted in other provinces adopting the same ideas, lest their leaders be accused of being soft on terrorism or of having ideological sympathy for Islam...

> For China’s Muslim citizens, vast numbers of whom see themselves as loyal Chinese, the turn against their faith and history is already a tragedy. But with Islamophobia fueled by both the terror of Xinjiang and the anger of ordinary Chinese, there may be worse to come.

> China has pledged to “sinify” Islam over the next four years, amid signs that a security crackdown that has seen the internment of millions of the country’s Muslims could spread.

> Beijing has been more tolerant of religious practices by the Hui than by the Uighurs. But party officials from Ningxia, a region with a large Hui population, toured prisons in Xinjiang in November and signed a “counter-terrorism co-operation” agreement with authorities in the region. China has also discouraged halal food and allowed hostile comments against the Hui to spread in its heavily-censored internet.

## Winter is coming

[As China feels US tariffs bite, a chill spreads around the world](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/05/china-economy-slowdown-us-tariffs-trade-war) <br> *by Lily Kuo, from theguardian.com, 20190105*

> It epitomises China’s position in the global economy that a seismic warning about its health last week came from a US company: Apple. The iPhone maker cut sales forecasts, citing the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in China – a vital growth market. At the same time the head of Baidu, China’s biggest search engine, warned his employees that “winter is coming” in the world’s second-largest economy.
>
> If China is indeed entering an economic winter, then the chill will spread around the globe. Forty years after communist China opened its doors to trade with the west in a dash for growth, the country’s mix of free-market policies and central planning faces one of its sternest tests.

> In a mirror image, Apple is spending as aggressively on R&D as China, hoping that will solve its problems too. Apple is indubitably innovative and the scale of its research should throw up new products; it is already developing a great service business. For China, the message is even starker. A one-party state can’t risk any bumps – and there are more than bumps ahead. Nothing, not even the wondrous success of the iPhone, lasts for ever. And that is especially true for a dysfunctional Chinese economy, and the party that runs it.

[The rhetoric is changing but Xi Jinping is staying the course](https://www.ft.com/content/7c90ac22-101a-11e9-b2f2-f4c566a4fc5f) <br> *by George Magnus, from ft.com, 20190106*

> The year just ended was a hard one for Chinese president Xi Jinping, and 2019 looks no easier. He has had to acknowledge sudden and unusual domestic criticism of his two signature policies, the Belt and Road Initiative and Made in China 2025, and, seemingly, pulled back from both. The air is rich with speculation about change. Whether this is about optics or substance, it will determine the outcome of the trade war truce with the US and shape China’s economic prospects.
