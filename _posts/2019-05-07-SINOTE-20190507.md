## China-US

[The US-China trade talks are at risk of breakdown](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/05/06/the-us-china-trade-talks-are-at-risk-of-breakdown) <br> *from economist.com, 20190506*

> Mr Trump might have thought that his threat would ratchet up pressure on China, helping to squeeze out more concessions just before the finishing-line. Instead, there is a real chance that he might provoke a hardening of China’s position. Some even speculated that Mr Liu and his travelling band of officials would pull out of this week’s meetings. “Let Trump raise tariffs. Let’s see when trade talks can resume,” tweeted Hu Xijin, editor of *Global Times*, a state-owned Chinese tabloid known for its nationalist streak. (Chinese regulators seem content to let Mr Hu use software to evade the Great Firewall and send out such messages on Twitter, which is otherwise blocked in China.)

> A full-on trade war would, unquestionably, be damaging for both countries. As the bigger exporter, China would probably suffer more. But Mr Trump is fooling himself if he thinks that he can bring China to its knees with tariffs and that America itself will be unscathed. Over the past half-year, China’s government has administered a moderate stimulus that has stabilised growth and fuelled a big rebound in its stockmarket. Even with Monday’s plunge, Chinese stocks are still up by 25% since the start of the year. The government has kept fiscal firepower in reserve, in part because of uncertainty about the trade war. Increasing its stimulus programme would help cushion the blow from higher tariffs. As for America, consumers there have largely been shielded from the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports because they have been focused on industrial inputs. If tariffs were to be applied on all imports, consumers would not be spared: the cost of goods from pillows to smartphones would rise sharply.

> At the Red Berry Café in Muscatine, New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand — another of the Democratic hopefuls — took aim at Mr Trump, saying that when he “creates a trade war with China he’s crushing our local farmers and it’s making it impossible for them to make ends meet”.
>
> Yet while the Democratic contenders were willing to discuss the trade war when asked, most have not made it a prominent issue in the campaign in Iowa, which holds the first caucuses in the 2020 primary race next February and is an important swing state in the general election. 
>
> One Democratic strategist says this reticence is explained by the conundrum the candidates face: it is “easy to say” that they do not like Mr Trump’s trade war but much more difficult to explain how they would confront China.
>
> “There will be virtual unanimity that tariffs are bad, but there will also be a strong view that we have to get tough on China and that going forward we need better trade deals,” he says. “On both of those propositions, Democrats will be saying things that at least on the face [of it] don’t sound too different from Trump.”

> During a closed-door meeting with Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz last week, Xi Jinping was asked what he thought the chances were for a successful conclusion of this week’s China-US trade talks in Washington. “Fifty-fifty,” the Chinese president replied, according to three people briefed on the discussion.
>
> Those odds changed dramatically on Monday morning after Mr Xi was greeted by tweets from US president Donald Trump threatening to [raise tariffs](https://www.ft.com/content/c5847a30-6f56-11e9-bbfb-5c68069fbd15) on Chinese exports to the US as early as Friday. The move enraged officials in Beijing.
>
> As of mid-afternoon on Monday, it appeared likely that Mr Xi’s lead trade negotiator would at least choose to delay his planned trip to Washington this week for a “final round” of trade talks that both sides had strongly hinted would result in a draft agreement.
>
> One Chinese government policy adviser told the Financial Times that executives at large state-owned enterprises who had planned to join vice-premier Liu He’s delegation were hastily rearranging their travel plans. Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were expected to play a central role in any agreement to end the trade war between the world’s two largest economies, because they would be the principal buyers of US agricultural and energy exports.
>
> Another person briefed on the negotiations said Chinese officials were still standing by for a shorter trip, with a much smaller delegation, later this week. “Everything is up for grabs,” the person said. “But it’s hard to believe they would leave if Trump is imposing new tariffs on Friday. That’s a big gamble for Xi.”

> The trade war, on the other hand, is the first real occasion to assess Mr. Xi’s leadership capabilities. And his performance might not look so good, even if one discounts the setbacks related to the trade war.
>
> First and foremost, Mr. Xi has utterly failed to manage the United States–Chinese relationship. In contrast, every Chinese leader since the founding of the communist state in 1949 had recognized the paramount importance of those ties, worked hard to improve them — and reaped huge benefits.
>
> ...
>
> Mr. Xi’s second major shortcoming has been his failure to articulate a coherent set of policies to stop the Chinese economy’s long-term weakening, after many years of stellar performance...
>

>
> A third criticism of Mr. Xi is that under him, China has sponsored or condoned actions by Chinese citizens and entities worldwide that have damaged the country’s international reputation while degrading its own moral fabric.

> China has faced [growing condemnation](https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2019/05/02/china-how-mass-surveillance-works-xinjiang) from human rights groups in recent months for its detention of up to one million ethnic Uighurs and other minority Muslims in [large internment camps](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html?module=inline) in the country’s northwest region of Xinjiang.

> But the Trump administration has studiously avoided rattling China by not raising the topic during the trade talks, viewing it as an impediment to securing what President Trump has said could be “the biggest deal ever made.”
>
> Administration officials have declined to use any of the economic leverage the White House amassed through tariffs placed on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to compel China to change its policies toward Uighurs.

> Around this time of the year, the edge of the Taklamakan desert in far western China should be overflowing with people. For decades, every spring thousands of Uighur Muslims would converge on the Imam Asim shrine, a group of buildings and fences surrounding a small mud tomb believed to contain the remains of a holy warrior from the eighth century.
>
> ...
>
> But this year, the Imam Asim shrine is empty. Its mosque, *khaniqah*, a place for Sufi rituals, and other buildings have been torn down, leaving only the tomb. The offerings and flags have disappeared. Pilgrims no longer visit.
>
> It is one of more than two dozen Islamic religious sites that have been partly or completely demolished in Xinjiang since 2016, according to an investigation by the Guardian and open-source journalism site Bellingcat that offers new evidence of large-scale mosque razing in the Chinese territory where rights groups say Muslim minorities suffer severe religious repression.
