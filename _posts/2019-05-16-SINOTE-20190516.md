## China-US

> Fighting over trade is not the half of it. The United States and China are contesting every domain, from semiconductors to submarines and from blockbuster films to lunar exploration. The two superpowers used to seek a win-win world. Today winning seems to involve the other lot’s defeat—a collapse that permanently subordinates China to the American order; or a humbled America that retreats from the western Pacific. It is a new kind of cold war that could leave no winners at all.
>
> As our special report in this week’s issue explains, superpower relations have soured. America complains that China is cheating its way to the top by stealing technology, and that by muscling into the South China Sea and bullying democracies like Canada and Sweden it is becoming a threat to global peace. China is caught between the dream of regaining its rightful place in Asia and the fear that tired, jealous America will block its rise because it cannot accept its own decline.

[How Xi’s Last-Minute Switch on U.S.-China Trade Deal Upended It](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/world/asia/trade-xi-jinping-trump-china-united-states.html) <br> *by Chris Buckley & Keith Bradsher, from nytimes.com, 20190516*

> In China’s top-down political system, where President Xi has amassed formidable power, it’s unlikely that anyone else would have had the authority — or, for that matter, the nerve — to fundamentally alter the emerging pact at this late date.
>
> Having apparently made that decision, it is clear that Mr. Xi misjudged Mr. Trump’s eagerness for a deal and how far he could push the American negotiators, according to more than a dozen people, including current and former officials, researchers, lawyers, and trade experts familiar with the deal and how it fell apart.
>
> Now Mr. Xi risks being backed into a corner, unable to compromise between his own positions and Mr. Trump’s.
>
> A key issue was the United States’ demand that the agreement bind China to setting some of the changes in domestic law. For Mr. Xi, such a move could be seen at home as a sign of caving in.

[Trade is just an opening shot in a wider US-China conflict](https://www.ft.com/content/9317cc0e-7664-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) <br> *by Philip Stephens, from ft.com, 20190516*

> Until quite recently, China was viewed as an economic competitor playing an unfair game. It cheated the system by manipulating trade and investment rules, forcing technology transfer from western partners and stealing intellectual property. In the US, the anger at such practices has been widely shared by Democrats as well as Republicans. Europeans have voiced the same irritation with China’s restrictive investment conditions and asymmetric trade rules. 
>
> The trade narrative is now being subsumed into a much more alarming one. Economics has merged with geopolitics. China, you can hear on almost every corner in sight of the White House and Congress, is not just a dangerous economic competitor but a looming existential threat. Beijing may not have the same ideological ambitions as the Soviet Union, but it does threaten US primacy. It needs more than a level playing field for trade to confront this challenge.

> Western companies, including brand name apparel makers and food companies, have become entangled in China’s campaign to [forcibly assimilate its Muslim population](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-hard-edge-the-leader-of-beijings-muslim-crackdown-gains-influence-11554655886?mod=article_inline).

> Adidas AG, Hennes & Mauritz AB, Kraft Heinz Co. , Coca-Cola Co. and Gap Inc. are among those at the end of the long, often opaque supply chains that travel through China’s northwest region of Xinjiang. Residents there are routinely forced into training programs that feed workers to area factories, according to locals, official notices and state media.
>
> Political indoctrination is a significant component of the programs, which are aimed at ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, according to official notices. Along with vocational skills, the curriculum covers Mandarin Chinese, the importance of the Communist Party and national unity, Chinese law and how to counter extremism—such as not dressing too conservatively or praying too frequently. The programs can include militarylike drills.
>
> For workers and factory bosses, resistance to such programs could result in detention as suspected extremist sympathizers. 
>
> Some companies said such compulsory training programs would contravene their policies for suppliers, which mandate responsible workplace conditions, free of discrimination. 
>
> Much of this has taken place under the radar. Beijing has directed Chinese companies to bring jobs to Xinjiang, often through subcontracting that isn’t known to Western companies, as part of the government’s effort to reduce what it says is violence and religious extremism in the area.

[Poetry Meets Politics in Photos of China](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/lens/liu-heung-shing-china-photos.html) <br> *by Tiffany May, from nytimes.com, 20190515*

> Liu Heung Shing looked outside the car window: an imposing portrait of Mao Zedong had disappeared from the east side of Tiananmen Square. It was 1981.
>
> Mao loomed large that year as people gathered to watch the depositions of his political cronies, known as the Gang of Four, on state television.  Earlier that autumn, before Mao’s portrait was removed from a history museum in Tiananmen Square, Mr. Liu photographed a skater gliding past a statue of Mao. The frozen faces of Communist leaders got a breath of fresh air in Mr. Liu’s photography: A Beijing resident in 2008 lined the facade of her house with the portraits of lionized figures, in plucky defiance of demolitions planned before the Summer Olympics.
>
> “It’s very lucky that I could use the camera to do a kind of political reporting that wouldn’t otherwise be possible,” Mr. Liu said. “That daily nitty-gritty about how Chinese live is primarily what interests me because I knew they would tell a bigger story.”
>
> Mr. Liu’s new book of photographs, [“A Life in a Sea of Red” (Steidl)](https://steidl.de/Books/A-Life-in-a-Sea-of-Red-0311164760.html), starts after Mao’s death in 1976, spanning years of political upheaval in China and the Soviet Union. From the pro-democracy student protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 to Mikhail Gorbachev’s resignation in 1991, Mr. Liu captured turning points in history. But he was even more interested in the collision of politics and daily life.
