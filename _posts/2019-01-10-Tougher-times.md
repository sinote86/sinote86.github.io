> The people briefed on the matter described the three days of negotiations as cordial and said both sides made progress on issues related to purchases of American goods and services and greater market access. But no breakthrough was achieved in addressing more challenging issues, such as a reduction in Chinese subsidies, these people said.

> China is becoming a more unequal place for women, in 2018 slipping for a fifth consecutive year in the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap index.  Chairman Mao may have proclaimed that women can hold up half the sky, but the Communist party under Xi Jinping holds a far narrower view of female roles, cracking down on feminist activists and backing traditional values.  The impact is economic too, with research showing that being born female in China has a bigger impact on your earnings than any other variable, including family wealth.  This month, Louisa and Graeme are joined by two experts on the origins of China's gender divide, Leta Hong Fincher, who's just published a book called Betraying Big Brother and economist Jane Golley from the Australian National University.

[China’s #MeToo Activists Have Transformed a Generation](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/10/chinas-metoo-activists-have-transformed-a-generation/) <br> *by Simina Mistreanu, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190110*

> China’s #MeToo campaign has already brought real change—but it has also imposed limits on itself to avoid spurring a reaction that could end the movement while seeking ways to leverage what power it has.
>
> The feminist leaders are highly educated and politically adept. In order to avoid the possibility of a clampdown, they don’t mobilize crowds or stage public protests. Instead, they skillfully use social media, negotiate with the authorities, and offer support to survivors. They come up with feasible solutions that don’t challenge the state—such as proposing anti-sexual harassment legislation, on-campus prevention mechanisms, and a helpline for victims—before they even raise the problem.
>
> “We are an unprecedented and unrepeatable generation,” said Xiao Meili, one of China’s better-known feminists, who has been active since 2011. Social movements, she said, happen “when conditions get better, and then they get worse again.”

> The Chinese police, in a sharp escalation of the country’s online censorship efforts, are questioning and detaining a growing number of Twitter users even though the social media platform is blocked in China and the vast majority of people in the country cannot see it.
>
> The crackdown is the latest front in President Xi Jinping’s campaign to expand the government’s suppression of internet activity beyond China’s borders. In effect, the authorities are extending their control over Chinese citizens’ online lives no matter where they post.

> Short-video platforms that have exploded in popularity in China will face more explicit censorship and potentially higher costs after an industry group issued new rules that forbid 100 content categories from defaming Chinese leaders to encouraging extramarital affairs.
>
> The guidelines released on Wednesday by the government-appointed body also require the platforms to bulk up censorship and vet all content before it is posted.
