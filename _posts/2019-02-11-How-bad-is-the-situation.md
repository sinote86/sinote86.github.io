>
> Consumption is increasingly important for Chinese growth, accounting for most new spending in the economy last year. But consumer sentiment weakened in recent months as efforts to tame credit growth hit corporate investment.
>
> “Weak consumption during the lunar new year holidays in 2019 does not bode well for overall retail sales growth,” said analysts at Nomura. “We maintain our call for economic growth to slow further in the first half of 2019.”

> Fourth-quarter results from U.S. companies highlight the many and varied ways that China’s cooling economy affects American business, and, in turn, offer a glimpse of what’s happening inside China. The indications are that slowing growth there is broad, if still modest.
>
> For U.S. businesses, the repercussions extend well beyond slowing sales at companies with the biggest exposure to China’s vast economy.
>
> Companies like EnerSys are struggling with weaker demand from export manufacturers in China, which are pulling back amid fears that trade tensions will worsen. Retailers and other companies catering to Chinese consumers face signs of weakness among the country’s growing middle class. They are buying fewer cars, phones and are traveling less.

> Foreign investors poured a record $9bn into Chinese equities in January, the largest single-month inflow on record, betting the mainland market has bottomed out after a disastrous 2018 and anticipating that a more dovish US Federal Reserve will boost emerging markets. 
>
> A more positive outlook for US-China trade talks is also brightening sentiment, with many investors taking the view that negotiations are likely to produce at least a deal to forestall an immediate increase in tariffs. 

## Xinjiang

> On Sunday, the state-owned China Radio International’s Turkish edition released a video of Heyit, dated 10 February, while the Chinese embassy in Turkey said Ankara had “seriously violated the facts”. The following day, the foreign ministry said Turkey’s statement was an “absurd lie”.

> The video is Heyit’s first public appearance in almost two years. The musician, known throughout the Turkic-language world for his poetry and performances of traditional Uighur music, is believed to have been arrested in April 2017, according to former colleagues. Heyit’s son was reportedly able to visit him, but friends said they have not heard from him since he was detained.
>
> The video is also a rare rebuttal from China. It is uncommon for Beijing to respond directly to specific cases of individuals believed to be detained in Xinjiang.

> One side, championed in China, is a digital landscape where mobile payments have replaced cash. Smartphones are the devices that matter, and users can shop, chat, bank and surf the web with one app. The downsides: The government reigns absolute, and it is watching—you may have to communicate with friends in code. And don’t expect to access Google or Facebook.
>
> On the other side, in much of the world, the internet is open to all. Users can say what they want, mostly, and web developers can roll out pretty much anything. People accustomed to China’s version complain this other internet can seem clunky. You must toggle among apps to chat, shop, bank and surf the web. Some websites still don’t seem to be designed with smartphones in mind.
>
> The two zones are beginning to clash with the advent of the superfast new generation of mobile technology called 5G. China aims to be the biggest provider of gear underlying the networks, and along with that it is pushing client countries to adopt its approach to the web—essentially urging some to use versions of the “Great Firewall” that Beijing uses to control its internet and contain the West’s influence.
