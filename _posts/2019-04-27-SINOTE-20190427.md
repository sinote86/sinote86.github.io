## Slowdown

[China’s shrinking cities: ‘Most of my classmates have left’](https://www.ft.com/content/bd1e1bf2-661f-11e9-a79d-04f350474d62) <br> *by Tom Hancock, from ft.com, 20190426*

> From the early 2000s, nationwide infrastructure and property investment allowed heavy industry to expand and produced strong growth, a process intensified by a massive government stimulus following the global financial crisis in 2008.
>
> But by 2015 even official statistics — widely thought to exaggerate the country’s performance — showed growth below 5 per cent in the north-east. One of the region’s three provinces experienced a 1 per cent contraction, virtually unheard of in contemporary China. 
>
> The problems afflicting the region — unproductive companies, weakening consumer demand and overinvestment in heavy industry — reflect challenges China will face more broadly as it attempts to make the transition from middle-income to developed-country status.
>
> Corruption is another issue. The ties between officials and state-run companies which emerged in the planned-economy era mean the north-east enjoys an almost unparalleled reputation for graft, deterring private investment.

> This farm grows bikes, by the looks of it. Hundreds of blue and mint-green bicycles stand in rows on this field in Wangqingtuo, the small community that calls itself “bicycle town.” Only the occasional caretaker and a pen of bleating goats watch over them as they rust. 
>
> Just a year ago, global investors were throwing money at Chinese companies that rented those bicycles to consumers. Bicycle start-ups became “unicorns,” or new companies worth more than $1 billion. This town, home to factories that made many of the bikes, prospered.
>
> Now the boom has become China’s latest investment bust. Too many bikes litter the streets of Chinese cities. Some start-ups hit financial trouble. Wangqingtuo now has closed factories, a work force that’s leaving and too many bikes.
