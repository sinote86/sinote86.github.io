It is not easy to talk about the role of the mass media in this overwhelmingly[^1] significant phase[^2] in European history. History and news become confused[^3], and one’s impressions tend to be a mixture of skepticism[^4] and optimism. 46) <u>Television is one of the means[^5] by which these feelings are created and conveyed—and perhaps never before has it served so much to connect different peoples[^6] and nations as in the recent events in Europe.</u> The Europe that is now forming cannot be anything other than its peoples, their cultures and national identities. With this in mind we can begin to analyse the European television scene[^7]. 47) <u>In Europe, as elsewhere, multi-media groups have been increasingly successful; groups which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses[^8] that work in relation[^9] to one another.</u> One Italian example would be the [Berlusconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi) group, while abroad [Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Maxwell) and [Murdoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch) come to mind.

49) <u>Creating a ‘European identity[^20]’ that respects the different cultures and traditions which go to make up the connecting fabric[^21] of the Old Continent[^22] is no easy task and demands a strategic choice</u>—that of producing programs in Europe for Europe. This entails[^23] reducing our dependence on the North American market, whose programs relate to experiences and cultural traditions which are different from our own.

In order to achieve these objectives[^24], we must concentrate more on co-productions, the exchange of news, documentary services and training. This also involves the agreements between European countries for the creation of a European bank for Television Production which, on the model of European Investment Bank, will handle the finances necessary for production costs. 50) <u>In dealing with a challenge on such a scale[^25], it is no exaggeration[^26] to say, ‘[United we stand, divided we fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_we_stand,_divided_we_fall)’</u>—and if I had to choose a slogan it would be ‘Unity in our diversity.’ A unity of objectives that nonetheless[^27] respect the varied peculiarities[^28] of each country.
