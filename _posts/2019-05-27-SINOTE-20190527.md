[Beijing’s relentless march to eliminate poverty](https://www.ft.com/content/c8e6c8c0-6d9b-11e9-a9a5-351eeaef6d84) <br> *by Lucy Hornby, from ft.com, 20190527*

> Even as Beijing faces the implications of [a slowdown in growth](https://www.ft.com/content/9903d7e2-5c43-11e9-939a-341f5ada9d40), eliminating absolute poverty is [President Xi Jinping’s](https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Xi_Jinping) signature domestic policy, a project that ranks among the [grandiose plans of China’s past](https://www.ft.com/content/839ccb0c-e439-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad) in its scale and ambition for the complete transformation of society. Plans hatched in Beijing include rewards for local officials who exceed their targets, resulting in a single-minded mobilisation of resources with little regard for the cost.
>
> China is already admired for transforming itself in just 40 years from one of the poorest countries in the world to the second-largest economy, with market reforms and massive doses of foreign investment that allowed about 700m Chinese to work their way out of poverty. But that transformation is far from complete.
>
> [Anti-poverty plans](https://www.ft.com/content/093860ce-80c5-11e8-bc55-50daf11b720d) focus on “three regions and three prefectures”, engulfing 18m people on the Tibetan plateau and in Xinjiang province, on the central Asian frontier, as well as in Linxia, a Hui Muslim area in Gansu province, and in Liangshan, home to the Yi or Lolo people in Sichuan province. Nujiang, a river valley in Yunnan, has fewer people but absolute poverty is “deeper”, afflicting a third of the population.

[Today’s China will never be a superpower](https://www.ft.com/content/233b101e-7d51-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560) <br> *by Charles Parton, from ft.com, 20190527*

> China wants to be a superpower, or even *the* global superpower, by the middle of this century. That is the meaning of Xi Jinping’s second “centennial goal”: becoming a “strong, democratic, civilised, harmonious and modern socialist country” by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. It won’t be so. 
>
> Whether you use the original definition of superpower status — the possession of pre-eminent military power and the ability to project it globally — or whether you broaden it to include economic, political, cultural and intelligence power, and the ability to shape international governance, what matters is the long-term capacity to pay for it all. 
>
> The costs China bears today are small compared with those it would need to shoulder — for decades — as a superpower. Its military expenditure falls far short of America’s. Domestically, the costs of repression and stability are said to be even greater than the budget of the People’s Liberation Army. An ageing population of 1.4bn requires a comprehensive social security system. The costs of rectifying the environment are mind-boggling.

[China wages relentless crackdowns on its Muslims. But Saudi Arabia stays quiet as it bolsters ties with Beijing.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-wages-relentless-crackdowns-on-its-muslims-but-saudi-arabia-stays-quiet-as-it-bolsters-ties-with-beijing/2019/05/24/66b52b44-7320-11e9-9331-30bc5836f48e_story.html) <br> *by Kareem Fahim, from washingtonpost.com, 20190527*

> Saudi Arabia’s acquiescence showed the fruits of a relentless campaign by China to quell any criticism from Muslim-majority nations.
>
> Over the past six months, the campaign has focused on members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It has been so vigorous — involving a corps of Chinese diplomats, economic inducements as well as threats — that some of the 57 member states regarded China’s entreaties as a national security matter, according to people familiar with Beijing’s lobbying effort.
>
> China leaned heavily on Saudi Arabia and its principal and influential ally, the United Arab Emirates, making direct appeals to the leadership of those two countries while betting that they would be able to help sway other Muslim states, the people briefed on China’s campaign said.
>
> Saudi Arabia’s position highlighted the dramatic shifts in the kingdom’s policies under the leadership of the crown prince, who has sought to confront or co-opt Saudi religious conservatives. Mohammed seeks to craft a new Saudi identity that leans more heavily on nationalism than religion.

[Trump Wants to Wall Off Huawei, but the Digital World Bridles at Barriers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/us/politics/us-huawei-berlin-wall.html)  <br> *by David E. Sanger, from nytimes.com, 20190527*

> President Trump has finally succeeded in building his wall: not the one he keeps demanding on the southwestern border, but a far more complex barrier meant to block China’s national telecommunications champion, Huawei, from operating in the United States and starve it of American technology as it builds networks around the globe.
>
> After a flurry of new government edicts, Huawei, the world’s second-largest cellphone maker after it edged out Apple last year, will soon be entirely cut off from American-made technology. By the end of summer, new Huawei phones will come without Google apps. And American computer chip companies are cutting off supplies that Huawei depends on for building [fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/personaltech/5g-what-you-need-to-know.html?module=inline).
>
> But the fight is about far more than merely crippling one Chinese telecom giant. [Mr. Trump and his aides want to force nations](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html?module=inline) to make an agonizing choice: Which side of a new Berlin Wall do they want to live on?

[She Thought She’d Married a Rich Chinese Farmer. She Hadn’t.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/world/asia/pakistan-china-trafficking.html) <br> *by Salman Masood & Amy Qin, from nytimes.com, 20190527*

> Rabia Kanwal’s parents were sure her marriage to a wealthy Chinese Muslim she had just met would give her a comfortable future, far from the hardships of their lives in Pakistan. But she had a premonition.
>
> ...
>
> Arranged marriages are common in Pakistan, but this one was unusual. The groom, who said he was a rich poultry farmer, met Ms. Kanwal’s family during a monthslong stay on a tourist visa. He had to use a Chinese-Urdu translation app to communicate with them, but over all, he made a favorable impression.
>
> Ms. Kanwal went through with the wedding. But upon moving to China with her new husband in February, she said, she was disappointed by what she found: He was a poor farmer, not a wealthy one. Far worse, he was not a Muslim. Within days, with the help of the Pakistani Embassy, she was back home and pursuing a divorce.
>
> Hers was a relatively happy ending, though. In recent weeks, Pakistan has been rocked by charges that at least 150 women were [brought to China as brides under false pretenses](https://www.geo.tv/latest/236821-fia-continues-crackdown-against-chinese-nationals-involved-in-human-trafficking) — not only lied to, but in some cases forced into prostitution. Others said they were made to work in bars and clubs, an unacceptable practice in Pakistan’s conservative Muslim culture.
>
> At the same time, Ms. Kanwal’s story is not uncommon in China.
