[Donald Trump, China Savior? Some Chinese Say Yes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/business/trump-china.html) <br> *by Li Yuan, from nytimes.com, 20190416*

> At dinner tables, in social media chats and in discreet conversations, some of the country’s intellectual and business elite are half-jokingly, half-seriously cheering on the leader who has built a large part of his political career on China-bashing. 
>
> “Only Trump can save China,” goes one quip. Others call him the “chief pressure officer” of China’s reform and opening. 
>
> Their semi-serious praise reflects the deepening despair among those in China who fear their country is on the wrong track. An aggressive outsider like President Trump, according to this thinking, can help China find its way again.

[Being Tracked While Reporting in China, Where ‘There Are No Whys’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/insider/china-xinjiang-reporting-surveillance-uighur.html) <br> *by Paul Mozur, from nytimes.com, 20190416*

> I was [in Kashgar to report](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-china-surveillance-prison.html) on how the Chinese authorities had turned to technology to cement their control of the Xinjiang territory, a region in the west of the country. Foreign journalists who travel there are tracked. I became one of the watched.

> When I was wide awake, my followers were by turns menacing and buffoonish. There were seven of them, and they took down the information of anyone I spoke to, making it too dangerous to interview residents. The police stopped me many times a day at checkpoints, demanding to look through my phone and often deleting photos and videos. At times, angry officials turned me around and prohibited me from visiting certain areas.
>
> They stayed in the hotel room across the hall from mine. The smell of their cigarettes wafted through the air ducts. They kept close as I walked down alleyways. One day I took them nearly 19 miles without stopping for food. The next day they showed up with a bike. When a sandstorm hit and I stayed out, they bought face masks and kept up. They’d linger at the urinals during bathroom pit stops, waiting for me.

[How Xi overplayed his hand with America](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/how-xi-overplayed-his-hand-with-america/2019/04/16/de39df54-608b-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html) <br> *by David Ignatius, from washingtonpost.com, 20190416*

> In the rebalancing of Sino-American relations that’s underway, the usual roles are reversed: China’s normally deft President Xi Jinping appears to have badly overreached in seeking advantage. And President Trump, who often seems tone-deaf on foreign policy, is riding a bipartisan consensus that it’s time to push back against Beijing.
>
> The two nations will [probably make](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mnuchin-says-trade-talks-near-final-round-11555188048) a trade deal soon, patching together a working relationship that has been frayed by about a year of tariffs and economic brinkmanship...
>
> But as Xi jockeyed for position against the United States, many U.S. experts argue that he misplayed his hand. After decades of what was known as China’s [“hide and bide” strategy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/china-has-a-plan-to-rule-the-world/2017/11/28/214299aa-d472-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html) of cautious cooperation, the Chinese leader moved to directly challenge U.S. primacy in technology. This eventually triggered a sharp, bipartisan U.S. response, which Trump has harvested.

[The Taiwanese Populist Advancing China’s Interests](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/taiwanese-populist-han-kuo-yu-china/587146/) <br> *by Chris Horton, from theatlantic.com, 20190416*

> The scene is, on the surface, a familiar one. A populist candidate with unexpected momentum captures nonstop media attention and sees a surge of support online, much of it connected to accounts originating from a rival country. Could he become president?
>
> The candidate is not, however, Donald Trump, and the country where the election is taking place is not the United States, or anywhere nearby. Yet the outcome is of crucial importance to Washington and its foreign policy.
>
> Welcome to Taiwan, where Han Kuo-yu, a once–washed-up former legislator, shocked this island of 23 million last year by beating out the early favorite to become the mayor of Kaohsiung—an office that, in American terms, has the same political currency as that of the governor of Texas or Florida. And with a presidential election coming up in January, a growing chorus of voices on the China-friendly side of Taiwan’s political spectrum is calling for this Trumpian figure to enter the fray. Han has not officially said that he will run, but he has already enchanted much of the Taiwanese electorate, and has a good chance of becoming Taiwan’s next president.
