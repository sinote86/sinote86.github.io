## Slowdown

[China’s Slowdown Looms Just as the World Looks for Growth](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/business/china-economy-growth-davos.html) <br> *by Keith Bradsher, from nytimes.com, 20190120*

> China’s huge economy, a major driver of global growth, is cooling just when the world needs its spark. Data released by Beijing in recent months shows softer investment, unprofitable factories and consumers who are no longer so quick to open their wallets.
>
> It is happening at a difficult time. The broader world outlook is beginning to dim. The American economy, which has powered ahead in recent years with strong growth and low unemployment, is showing some signs of a slowdown and is facing higher short-term interest rates that could act as a brake. Europe’s resurgence is beginning to show its age, too, with even Germany’s industrial engine starting to sputter.
>
> In the past, China has helped the world out of such weak spots, most notably during the global financial crisis. But this time, its economy is showing pronounced weakness.

> This time around, the leadership is moving more cautiously, adopting a piecemeal approach to monetary and fiscal easing, while swearing off what it calls “flood-irrigation stimulus”—a reference to the aggressive pro-growth policies of the past.

>
> Behind the shift in the Chinese leadership’s attitude is an acute realization that options on stimulus are more constrained than in the past. Previous rounds of easy credit and lavish government spending stoked growth but caused a surge in debt, particularly among local governments and state-owned companies. The current debt level, estimated at more than 250% of China’s GDP, is “a bit too high,” said a senior economic adviser to the leadership who asked to remain anonymous.

> Also staying the leadership’s hands, at least for now, is uncertainty over the unfolding U.S.-China trade conflict. Advisers to the Chinese government say Beijing needs to keep some stimulus measures in reserve in case the world’s two leading economies fail to reach a deal and return to placing tariffs on each other’s goods.

> China’s leaders say the country’s slowdown is a natural and welcome thing, a transition to a new consumer-led economy. There are plenty of others who say it is the result of the reversion to command and control policies.

> As Mr Xi noted in his 2017 Davos speech, after China opened up in the 1980s it attracted more than $1.7tn of foreign investment and made a huge contribution to global growth. Today, both capital flows and growth are decreasing. Some of the slowdown is due to the US-China trade war. But just as US economic problems start at home, so do China’s.

## Xinjiang

[Detainees Are Trickling Out of Xinjiang’s Camps](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/18/detainees-are-trickling-out-of-xinjiangs-camps/) <br> *by Gene A. Bunin, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190118*

> For most of the released, the freedom obtained is only partial at best. While a large number have been placed under what appears to be surveilled house arrest, some of the documented releases were let out only to be transferred to factories or other compulsory labor...
>
> Cases such as Auelkhan’s—of being released and allowed to leave China—are rare but not unprecedented. However, they are not the happy endings that one would like to envision, as nearly all imply broken families or some sort of tragedy and trauma, with the Chinese state taking every measure it can to ensure that “what happens in Xinjiang stays in Xinjiang.”

> ...
>
> The releases appear to be part of a wider Chinese attempt to create an alternative narrative of the crimes against humanity being committed in Xinjiang, especially when added to the recent [state propaganda](http://en.people.cn/n3/2018/1023/c90000-9511129.html) glorifying the policies and the [Potemkin visits](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang-insight/china-says-pace-of-xinjiang-education-will-slow-but-defends-camps-idUSKCN1P007W) of foreign journalists and diplomats. A number of Kazakhs, for whom there appears to exist a strong correlation between petitions and releases, fear that this is a means to diffuse momentum.

> Kazakhstan’s foreign ministry said this month that it had negotiated for the release of 2,000 Chinese Kazakhs from Xinjiang, where the UN estimates that up to 1m Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities are in political detention.
>
> But Kazakhstan-based activists and family members have told the Financial Times their loved ones remain in limbo in Xinjiang towns, under constant surveillance and unable to return home.

> The shift towards house arrests suggests Chinese authorities are looking at ways to quell the outcry but is unwilling to give complete freedom to former detainees. China said this month that the UN was free to inspect the region as long as it followed Chinese law and procedures and was “unbiased”.
