The homeless[^1] make up a growing percentage[^2] of America’s population. <u>1 Indeed</u>, homelessness[^1] has reached such proportions[^3] that local government can’t possibly <u>2 cope</u>. To help homeless people <u>3 toward</u> independence, the federal government must support job training programs, <u>4 raise</u> the minimum[^4] wage, and fund[^5] more low-cost housing.

<u>5 Not</u> everyone agrees on the numbers of Americans who are homeless. Estimates <u>6 range</u> anywhere from 600, 000 to 3 million. <u>7 Although</u> the figure may vary, analysts do agree on another matter: that the number of the homeless is <u>8 increasing</u>. One of the federal government’s studies <u>9 predicts</u> that the number of the homeless will reach nearly 19 million by the end of this decade.

Finding ways to <u>10 assist</u> this growing homeless population has become increasingly difficult. <u>11 Even</u> when homeless individuals manage to find a <u>12 shelter</u> that will give them three meals a day and a place to sleep at night, a good number still spend the bulk of each day <u>13 wandering</u> the street. Part of the problem is that many homeless adults are addicted to alcohol or drugs. And a significant number of the homeless have serious mental disorders. Many others, <u>14 while</u> not addicted or mentally ill, simply lack the everyday <u>15 survival</u> skills needed to turn their lives <u>16 around</u>. *Boston Globe* reporter Chris Reidy notes that the situation will improve only when there are <u>17 comprehensive</u> programs that address the many needs of the homeless. <u>18 As</u> Edward Zlotkowski, director of community service at Bentley College in Massachusetts, <u>19 puts</u> it, ‘There has to be <u>20 coordination</u> of programs. What we need is a package deal.’

In the absence of a global standard on social media advertising, it will take clever co-ordination by regulators to enforce discipline. (Financial Times)
