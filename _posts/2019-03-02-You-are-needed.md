## Xinjiang

[He Needed a Job. China Gave Him One: Locking Up His Fellow Muslims.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/asia/china-muslim-detention-uighur-kazakh.html) <br> *by Austin Ramzy, from nytimes.com, 20190302*

> The businesses he started had failed, and he had a wife and two children to support. So when the authorities in China’s far western Xinjiang region offered him a job with the auxiliary police, Baimurat welcomed the good pay and benefits.
>
> For months, he stood at roadside checkpoints, looking for people on the government’s blacklist, usually from Muslim ethnic minorities. As a Kazakh Muslim himself, he sometimes felt uncomfortable about his work, but he needed the money.
>
> Then he was asked to help bring 600 handcuffed people to a new facility — and was stunned by what he saw. Officials called it a job training center, but it was basically a prison, with toilets and beds behind bars. One detainee was an acquaintance he barely recognized because he had lost so much weight.

> In China’s semi-autonomous region of Xinjiang, authorities have locked up an estimated 1 million Uighur Muslims in internment camps. They have demolished mosques, banned the Uighur language from schools, and even used DNA to monitor the population. China says the crackdown is in response to the separatist movement in Xinjiang, but the Uighurs call it cultural genocide.

[Can China recover from its disastrous one-child policy?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/02/china-population-control-two-child-policy) <br> *by Lily Kuo & Xueying Wang, from theguardian.com, 20190302*

> Faced with a population that is shrinking and ageing, Chinese policymakers are attempting to engineer a baby boom after more than three decades of a Malthusian family planning regime better-known as the one-child policy. Central policy planners have loosened restrictions on family sizes, and now all married couples can have two children. There is talk of the limits being dropped altogether, and amid aggressive propaganda drives, local officials are experimenting with subsidies and incentives for parents.
>
> But these efforts appear to be too little too late. Birthrates have fallen and are likely to continue to drop as parents like Xu decide against having more children. More young women are pushing back against state propaganda and family pressure, while improving education standards and income levels have delayed marriage and childbirth. Moreover, decades of the one-child policy have made single-child households the norm, experts say.

> Nowhere is this trend more obvious than in China’s rust belt, the north-eastern region better-known as Dongbei which as the lowest birthrates in the country, the result of strict enforcement of family planning limits and the region’s early development. For residents in Shenyang, the largest city in Dongbei, in central Liaoning province, it’s obvious why few families are willing to have more children – the economy.
