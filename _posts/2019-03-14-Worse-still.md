## Slowdown

[China’s Slowdown Already Hit Its Factories. Now Its Offices Are Hurting, Too.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/business/china-economy-slowdown-white-collar-workers.html) <br> *by Alexandra Stevenson & Cao Li, from nytimes.com, 20190314*

> China’s slowdown, which has idled factories and construction sites, is rippling through its offices. Educated, white-collar workers are being hit with job cuts and shrinking paychecks. Even big technology companies like JD.com, the online retailer, and Didi Chuxing, China’s answer to Uber and one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, have not been spared.
>
> The white-collar job distress suggests the slowdown in China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is broader than official numbers indicate. China increasingly relies on middle-class spenders who are helping to broaden the economy beyond its industrial base. But these consumers are not spending the way they used to, and that lethargy is ricocheting through every part of the economy, from the real estate market to China’s once-thriving tech sector.
>
> The slowdown also suggests the government will have a harder time pulling the economy out of its slump.

[China’s Provinces Can’t Afford Beijing’s Development Plans](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/14/chinas-provinces-cant-afford-beijings-development-plans/) <br> *by Edoardo Campanella, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190314*

> The economic relationship between the different levels of Chinese government is complicated and uneasy. As a result of a convoluted fiscal system by which money is transferred from the central government to the provinces, local governments usually lack the funds needed to cover the expenses related to Beijing’s ambitious growth targets. In fact, provinces, towns, and counties receive roughly half of total tax revenues but are responsible for two-thirds of total government spending. And they have few ways to make up the money; until 2014, they could not even borrow money without the central government’s permission.
>
> For Beijing, this system ensures that local officials are dependent on (and compliant with) the capital. Communist Party leaders fear that, if not properly controlled, regional and subregional governments might drift from the center, undermining the country’s unity. Beijing is right to be worried. China consists of 23 provinces, 334 prefectures, and thousands of counties with diverse geographies, distinct cultural traditions, and disparate economic needs. The risk of political fragmentation is already high without granting financial autonomy to each administrative unit.
>
> However, over-centralization comes at a cost. Central planners aren’t well placed to identify the most profitable (or useful) infrastructure projects. China boasts the world’s highest bridge and its longest bridge. But projects like these pile up debt and breed corruption while producing little benefit for the locals whose true needs are hardly understood by a technical committee gathering in Beijing.

[China birth rate declines as childcare costs deter families](https://www.ft.com/content/f34bb0b0-2f8b-11e9-8744-e7016697f225) <br> *by Tom Hancock & Wang Xueqiao, from ft.com, 20190313*

> An increasing number of women in China are making the same choice. The number of new births in China fell by 2m last year to 15.2m — the second consecutive year of decline since China repealed its controversial “one child” policy in 2015. China’s population expanded by 0.38 per cent last year — a rate comparable with western European countries. That was the slowest pace since 1961, when the country was struggling with the aftermath of a famine that killed about 40m people.

> As well as overall population decline, an ageing population will intensify the shrinking of China’s workforce. The number of people aged over 60 will reach 479m, or about one-third of the population in 2050, up from about 16 per cent today, according to estimates from researchers at Renmin university in Beijing.

[A Flurry of Ideas to Reverse China’s Declining Birthrate, but Will Beijing Listen?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/world/asia/china-demograpic-crisis-birthrate.html) <br>*by Steven Lee Myers & Claire Fu, from nytimes.com, 20190313*

> One proposal would end financial penalties for babies born out of wedlock. Another would lower the legal age of marriage. Others would ban discrimination against mothers and mothers-to-be in the workplace and would expand or extend parental leave to fathers.
>
> China’s annual legislative session — the National People’s Congress — is typically a staid affair to aggrandize Communist Party rule, but this year it has produced a flurry of proposals to address what experts and officials now acknowledge is a [looming demographic crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/17/world/asia/china-population-crisis.html?module=inline) caused by the country’s sharply declining birthrate.
>
> The ideas now being floated by regional officials, businesspeople and others reflect the depth of the concern over the issue but also the fact that there is not yet a clear consensus on what the government should do about it.

## Xinjiang

[China’s assault on human rights is the one thing bringing Washington together](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/chinas-assault-on-human-rights-is-the-one-thing-bringing-washington-together/2019/03/14/923e65ac-4691-11e9-8aab-95b8d80a1e4f_story.html) <br> *by Josh Roginm, from washingtonpost.com, 20190314*

> It has become accepted Washington doctrine that, when it comes to foreign policy, the splits between the parties (and within them) are too wide to bridge. But there’s one issue bringing everyone together, even in this era of deep political and ideological discord: China’s horrific treatment of its Uighur Muslim population and other ethnic and religious minorities.
>
> Republicans and Democrats, isolationists and internationalists, the Trump administration and Congress, even Christians and Muslims all agree: This is a catastrophe the United States can no longer ignore. This rare consensus, made possible only by the mind-boggling cruelty and injustice the Chinese government is perpetrating on millions of its own people, has finally materialized in words — and will hopefully soon translate to action.

[Kazakhstan arrests a man who exposed China’s gulag](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/03/14/kazakhstan-arrests-a-man-who-exposed-chinas-gulag) <br> *from economist.com, 20190314*

> Serikzhan Bilash, an ethnic Kazakh from China who is a naturalised citizen of Kazakhstan, is a thorn in China’s side. The combative campaigner has helped expose the horrors of China’s gulag to the world: the network of camps in which perhaps 1m people have been interned in Xinjiang province, which borders Kazakhstan. Most of the detainees are Uighurs, Xinjiang’s main indigenous group. Others are Kazakhs and Kyrgyz. All these ethnicities speak Turkic languages and are mainly Muslim, like their kin in neighbouring Central Asia.
>
> ...
>
> Mr Bilash’s revelations have placed Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s president, in a diplomatic quandary, since he does not want to antagonise his mighty neighbour. His government has not condemned the camps explicitly, although Beybut Atamkulov, the foreign minister, acknowledges that there is “pressure” on China’s 1.5m Kazakhs. That is more than Central Asia’s other governments, which have found no fault at all with the treatment of their brethren across the border. Kyrgyzstan’s president, Sooronbay Jeyenbekov, openly admits to not wishing to “spoil relations” with China over the camps. His government has arrested people for participating in anti-Chinese protests. China, after all, is a formidable regional power, the main customer for Central Asia’s energy exports and the builder of much useful infrastructure in the region, as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.

[China’s selective version of Marxist theory is a puzzle](https://www.ft.com/content/c0a449cc-4595-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3) <br> *by Tom Hancock, from ft.com, 20190314*

> It is puzzling that the Communist party is stepping-up promotion of Marxist thought when it has largely abandoned its core tenet: public ownership of the means of production. About 80 per cent of urban workers are employed by private companies. Levels of wealth inequality are among the highest in the world, making egalitarianism potentially subversive.
>
> It is rendered more confusing by [a recent crackdown](https://www.ft.com/content/fd087484-2f23-11e9-8744-e7016697f225) on self-declared Marxist students at elite universities, demonstrating that the ideology still poses a threat to party rule.
>
> Part of the answer to this puzzle is that Beijing pushes a selective version of Marxism. It likes the theory of historical change that helps portray Communist party rule as inevitable, argues Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a historian of modern China. But it “plays down and sometimes leaves out completely talk of the mechanism the German theorist saw as driving the process: class struggle”.
