[Chinese Rights Lawyer Swept Up in Xi’s Crackdown Gets More Than 4 Years in Prison](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/world/asia/china-wang-quanzhang-human-rights.html) <br> *by Javier C. Hernández, from nytimes.com, 20190128*

> The lawyer, Wang Quanzhang, was found guilty of “subversion of state power,” the No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court of Tianjin [said on its website](http://tj2zy.chinacourt.org/article/detail/2019/01/id/3716862.shtml). That charge is usually applied to critics of the ruling Communist Party who are accused of organizing political challenges.
>
> Other lawyers and activists who had been picked up in an expansive campaign by the government that began in the summer of 2015 were either released or put on trial and sentenced. But Mr. Wang, 42, had been held for nearly three and a half years before he faced charges in a closed trial in Tianjin on Dec. 26 that even his wife was barred from attending.
>
> The crackdown, which included televised show trials in which lawyers confessed to plotting to overthrow the government and working on behalf of foreign forces, is a part of President Xi Jinping’s efforts to obliterate threats to the party’s control.

> Whatever the reason for the delay in Mr Wang's case - his brief one-day trial was finally held behind closed doors over Christmas - he has been found guilty for much the same reason: his attempts to use the letter of the Chinese law to hold the authorities to account in their own Communist Party-run courts.
>
> As the Party has been making clear in recent years, it sees concepts such as constitutionalism and an independent judicial system as dangerous Western ideals.
>
> Mr Wang's fate is likely intended to reinforce that chilling message.

## China-US

[U.S. Authorities Unveil Sweeping Set of Charges Against China’s Huawei](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-authorities-unveil-sweeping-set-of-actions-against-chinas-huawei-11548711284) <br> *by Kate O’Keeffe, Aruna Viswanatha & Dustin Volz, from wsj.com, 20190128*

> The Trump administration unveiled a sweeping set of criminal charges against China’s Huawei Technologies Co. in its latest salvo against the telecom giant, with authorities unsealing a pair of indictments just days before U.S.-China trade talks are set to resume.
>
> The charges are the latest to accuse the Chinese government or Chinese companies of stealing intellectual property from U.S. firms through a combination of cyberattacks, traditional espionage and other means. U.S. officials have warned that China’s corporate raiding of secrets, which some government estimates value into the hundreds of billions of dollars in damages annually, represents a pre-eminent national- and economic-security threat.

> There is a danger of applying double standards here. As the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed, American technology companies have been prepared to work with US spying agencies. US and other western intelligence activities, however, are quantitatively and qualitatively different from China’s. They focus on security and terrorism threats and are subject to far greater legal constraints.
>
> While Chinese authorities reject such accusations, evidence abounds from investigations and legal cases that Beijing’s security services are attempting to steal trade and technological secrets. China is also intent on spying on Chinese citizens and opposition overseas.

> The Chinese delegation, dozens strong and led by Vice Premier Liu He, plans to offer a big increase in purchases of U.S. farm products and energy, along with modest reforms in industrial policies, said people in China who are closely following the talks.
>
> But Beijing will fight U.S. demands for deep structural changes in the Chinese economy, these people said. Those demands have included eliminating subsidies to favored industries, as well as regulatory help and other aid to Chinese companies, especially state-owned enterprises.
