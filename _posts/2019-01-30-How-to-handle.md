## China-US

[Huawei and China, Facing U.S. Charges, Have Few Ways to Retaliate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/huawei-indictment-criminal-charges.html) <br> *by Paul Mozur & Raymond Zhong, from nytimes.com, 20190130*

> China is in the middle of a trade war that it is eager to end as its vast economy slows. Any effort to get tough on the United States — such as by detaining American nationals, as it did to Canadians after Ms. Meng was arrested — could scuttle the negotiations.

> Huawei’s Washington operations have undergone drastic turnover as it appears to rein in its sales ambitions in America and shift tactics in its relations with the government. In the second shake-up of its American leadership in less than a year, the company is replacing Regent Zhang, its head of government affairs in Washington, with Joy Tan, currently its head of global communications.

> Despite whispers in private security briefings and accusations from US politicians, there is no clear-cut evidence that China has ever asked Huawei to create a “back door” into western networks through its equipment, and Huawei insists that it would refuse. “We would rather shut Huawei down than do anything that would damage the interests of our customers,” Mr Ren said.
>
> The problem is structural, not ethical. No matter how trustworthy the Ren family, Huawei would have no choice but to comply if the party knocked on the door. China’s 2017 intelligence law, part of legislation enacted under President Xi Jinping, permits the security apparatus not only to spy on its citizens but to enlist co-operation globally. No would not be an acceptable answer.

> Despite Trump’s reckless tweeting, it’s highly unlikely that Meng’s arrest was timed to give Washington additional leverage over Beijing. She was arrested on charges of fraud connected to sanctions violations, and the U.S. criminal investigation of Huawei began long before the current round of U.S.-Chinese trade talks. Meng is not a hostage; her detention was a legitimate act of law enforcement.
>
> There is, however, a less transactional and more fundamental connection between the heightened scrutiny of Huawei and Washington’s trade war against Beijing: both stem from the growing tensions and mistrust between Western states and China in matters of technology, economic policy, and national security. Both are driven, in part, by the fear that the Chinese Communist Party’s grip on the country’s private sector means that Chinese companies cannot truly be independent from the Chinese state.

> Instead of spiralling into a cold war, leaders should create mechanisms and rules that favour trade by minimising mistrust. Both sides have a part to play. Host countries need to develop structures to monitor Huawei and to provide for a reasonable response if things go wrong. European political leaders complain that they have not been shown evidence of Huawei spying. The more credible and law-like America’s process is, the better. Britain has a board that allows spooks to review Huawei’s equipment. Germany has copied it and Singapore may follow. Governments can lower the risk by insisting on a diversity of suppliers. In a country with four networks, it would make sense if at least two were not built by Huawei.
>
> For its part, China Inc needs to get serious about demonstrating that it can be trusted abroad. Huawei’s governance is a mixture of obfuscation and opacity. It should appoint foreign directors, recruit Western investors and set up subsidiaries overseas that have their own boards and indigenous managers. China’s government, meanwhile, can complain that it is being treated unfairly, but if it really wants better treatment it should send a signal that it understands the anxieties it stirs up. The Huawei affair shows how President Xi Jinping’s growing authoritarianism is undermining China’s commercial interests abroad.

## Slowdown

[China’s slowdown is of its own doing](https://www.ft.com/content/0fb87bda-23c4-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf) <br> *by Harry Broadman, from ft.com, 20190130*

> What is at the core of China’s growth problem? Simply put, it’s the contradiction inherent in the country’s self-titled, oxymoronic “socialist market economy” programme, initially launched by Deng Xiaoping and formally enshrined in 1992. 
>
> At its roots, China is not a market-based economy. Its separation of business and government remains ephemeral. Property rights are ill-defined and unenforceable, providing strong incentives for corruption. Identification of beneficial owner(s) and of who has ultimate control over decisions in some of the country’s key enterprises is opaque. The large state-owned banks hold little check, if any, over the large, backbone state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to whom they lend, and which often never pay off debts owed. Communist party officials occupy some of the most senior positions in the enterprise and financial sectors, including the recent appointment of the country’s top banking regulator as party chief and deputy governor of the central bank.
>
> As well as all that there is a Potemkin non-state enterprise sector (often referred to as the “private” sector), which some well-respected China analysts a few years ago thought was on a sustainable growth path and would potentially overtake the SOEs’ role in the Chinese economy. But they were confused by *cyclical* aberrations (a bit of irrational exuberance) to a cemented *secular* trend of SOE dominance. In the past, the authorities worked to facilitate bank lending to the non-state sector. This year, there has been a return of the constraints placed on shadow banking, which is ossifying the flow of credit and raising funding costs to small and medium-sized private companies.

> From a deepening economic slowdown to a more confrontational U.S., the ruling Communist Party faces the greatest confluence of potential threats since the financial crisis a decade ago. The concern has been voiced by none other than Xi, who summoned ministers and provincial chiefs to Beijing last week to warn that “major risks” abound and their “long-term rule” wasn’t guaranteed.
>
> ...
>
> While the party bounced back and built China into a budding superpower, Xi’s warning fed speculation that he sees new dangers ahead. China’s leaders face a host of economic challenges, from protests over falling property prices and loan defaults to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs -- all converging on a year of politically sensitive dates, including the 30th anniversary of Tiananmen.

## Feature

[Can China Turn the Middle of Nowhere Into the Center of the World Economy?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/29/magazine/china-globalization-kazakhstan.html) <br> *by Ben Mauk, from nytimes.com, 20190130*

> About 80 miles from the Pole of Inaccessibility, just across the border in Kazakhstan, is a village called Khorgos. It has spent most of its existence on the obscure periphery of international affairs, and its official population is just 908. But over the last few years, it has become an important node of the global economy. It is part of an initiative known informally as the new Silk Road, a China-led effort to build a vast cephalopodic network of highways, railroads and overseas shipping routes, supported by hundreds of new plants, pipelines and company towns in dozens of countries. Ultimately, the Belt and Road Initiative, or B.R.I., as the project is more formally known, will link China’s coastal factories and rising consumer class with Central, Southeast and South Asia; with the Gulf States and the Middle East; with Africa; and with Russia and all of Europe, all by way of a lattice of land and sea routes whose collective ambition boggles the mind.
>
> Khorgos is a flagship project of this work in progress, an international shipping hub and free-trade zone that its promoters say is poised to become the next Dubai. Thanks to its location at the junction of the world’s soon-to-be-largest national economy and its largest landlocked country, Khorgos has become an unlikely harbinger of the interconnected planet: a zone fully enclosed by the logic of globalization, where goods flow freely across sovereign borders, following corridors designed to locate every human being on the planet within a totalizing network of producers and consumers, buyers and sellers.
>
> Such victories of the global and industrial over the local, isolated and rural are heralded as the inevitable future — if there is to be a future — of our species. What would that future look like? Whom would it benefit? What would it cost? To find out, last July I caught a sleeper train from Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, to the Chinese border, where I woke up in a train yard surrounded by desert.
