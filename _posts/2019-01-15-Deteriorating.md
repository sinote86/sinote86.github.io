## China-US

[Huawei’s Mysterious Founder Denies Spying for China, Praises Trump](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-ceo-hits-back-at-claims-company-spies-for-china-11547542616) <br> *by By Dan Strumpf & Josh Chin, from wsj.com, 20190115*

> “No law requires any company in China to install mandatory back doors,” Ren Zhengfei said Tuesday, referring to giving officials a key to access data on devices or networks. “I personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me, and my company would not answer to such requests.”
>
> ...
>
> Speaking in Chinese through an interpreter, Mr. Ren said he missed his daughter, Huawei finance chief Meng Wanzhou, but was optimistic justice would prevail. Ms. Meng was arrested Dec. 1 in Vancouver at the request of U.S. authorities, who accuse her of lying about the company’s business with Iran. She denies the charges.
>
> Huawei’s reclusive 74-year-old founder, a former army engineer, also praised President Trump as a “great president,” citing the administration’s tax cuts to boost businesses.

> China asked some state-run enterprises to avoid business trips to the U.S. and its allies and to take extra precautions to protect their devices if they need to travel, according to people familiar with the request.
>
> ...
>
> Chinese and American executives have become more cautious when traveling after the December arrest of Huawei Technologies Co. executive Meng Wanzhou in Canada on behalf of the U.S., and the subsequent detention of two Canadian citizens in China. The U.S. has also stepped up efforts to catch and prosecute executives at Chinese companies that it alleges steal technology, which has resulted in several legal actions.

> While the trade war has received the most attention, the economic tussle is part of a much more profound shift in the US that has seen Washington reverse important elements of the strategy of engaging with its Asian rival that was first introduced more than 40 years ago by Richard Nixon.
>
> Support for this change in approach has a broad base in the US. Officials across the US government have become significantly more hawkish towards China— over everything from human rights, politics and business to national security. At the same time, US companies and academics who once acted as a buffer against the harshest views are now far less sanguine.

## Slowdown

[China unleashes tax cuts in bid to halt economic slowdown](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/15/china-announces-package-tax-cuts-aid-slowing-economy) <br> *by Richard Partington, from theguardian.com, 20190115*

> While exact details of the stimulus package are yet to be unveiled, the Chinese finance ministry suggested the measures would include cutting value added tax for some companies, particularly in the manufacturing sector, as well as rebates for other businesses to ward off a more damaging slowdown.
>
> ...
>
> In a coordinated response, the Chinese central bank also promised to provide “enough” support for the economy without further fuelling the country’s debt boom.
>
> Economists have previously said Beijing has limited scope for stimulating the economy without raising borrowing to dangerous levels, given the rapid escalation of debt to the highest levels on record following the stimulus package it used to ward off the worst effects of the 2008 financial crisis.

[After Orders to Shrink, China's Small Banks Face a Tougher 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-15/after-orders-to-shrink-china-s-small-banks-face-a-tougher-2019) <br> *by Bloomberg News, from bloomberg.com, 20190115*

> China’s smaller banks, among the hardest hit by President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on risky financing, are set for a tougher 2019 as authorities force them to shut business lines that once powered profit growth.
>
> Authorities have ordered the nation’s provincial lenders to limit business to the region they’re based in, or wind down by the end of this year, and have said that some banks expand “blindly.” The new rules will contribute to lower profits at the small banks, which are already overvalued when compared with bigger rivals, according to analysts.

[Will China’s Economy Hit a Great Wall?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/opinion/will-chinas-economy-hit-a-great-wall.html) <br> *by Paul Krugman, from nytimes.com, 20190115*

> On one side, China’s problems are real. On the other, the Chinese government – hindered neither by rigid ideology nor by anything resembling a democratic political process – has repeatedly shown its ability and willingness to do whatever it takes to prop up its economy. It’s really anyone’s guess whether this time will be different, or whether Xi-who-must-be-obeyed can pull out another recovery.
>
> But maybe this is another example of Dornbusch’s Law, named after my old teacher Rudi Dornbusch: The crisis takes a much longer time coming than you think, and then it happens much faster than you would have thought. So it seems useful to summarize why people have been worried about China, and why China’s troubles are a problem for the rest of the world.

## Crackdown

[The Patriarchy Strikes Back in China](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/15/the-patriarchy-strikes-back-in-china/) <br> *by Leta Hong Fincher, from foreignpolicy.com, 20190115*

> This winter, Chinese authorities detained at least 12 young activists campaigning for labor rights in several cities, including kidnapping a student on the renowned Peking University campus and beating several of his classmates. Authorities have cracked down on student activists at other universities as well, including Renmin University, Nanjing University, and Sun Yat-sen University.
>
> Foreign news reports emphasize that the students are Marxist, but the latest uprising is far more broad-based. The latest flashpoint around elite students supporting labor rights is connected to a years-long women’s rights movement since at least 2012 that has become increasingly cross-class in nature, advocating for gender equality and workers’ rights. The Communist Party has responded to the rise in student activism against inequality by tightening ideological controls on university campuses across China and intensifying its crackdown on academic freedom and women’s rights activism, particularly when it intersects with labor rights activism.

[Denise Ho Confronts Hong Kong’s New Political Reality](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/21/denise-ho-confronts-hong-kongs-new-political-reality) <br> *by Jiayang Fan, from newyorker.com, 20190121*

> If a sense of the spiritual anchors Ho’s personal life, it is her political convictions that have come to define her public persona. Six years ago, she became the first major female star in Hong Kong to come out as gay, a significant move in a society that remains culturally conservative. Then, in 2014, during what became known as the Umbrella Revolution—protesters held up umbrellas as a protection against teargas—she joined thousands of people demonstrating against Beijing’s encroachments on the autonomy of Hong Kong.
>
> At the protests, Ho and a number of other Cantopop singers performed a song, “Raise the Umbrella,” that became the anthem of the movement. In the third month of demonstrations, she was arrested. The footage of her being led away by police furnished one of the enduring images of the protests. On the Chinese mainland, where Ho had been a burgeoning star, and where most of her income came from, she became persona non grata. State media outlets called her “a poison of Hong Kong,” and one editorial warned that the mainland sales Ho depended on were far from guaranteed: “Don’t think you can eat our food and smash our pots at the same time.” Since then, her music has been rigorously purged from streaming platforms in China, and she is banned from having a social-media presence there. As Beijing chips away at Hong Kong’s freedoms, Ho has become an emblematic figure of the territory—embattled, emboldened, and unbeholden.
