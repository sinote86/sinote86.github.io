## Trade talks continue

> The U.S. and China made progress on narrowing their differences on trade issues, especially on purchases of U.S. goods and services and widening access to China’s markets, though the two sides are far from striking a deal.
>
> In two intense days of talks in Beijing that will continue into Wednesday, U.S. and Chinese midlevel negotiators addressed a number of nettlesome issues and tried to specify how to ensure China will carry out pledges it made, according to people on both sides briefed on the discussions. The U.S. team isn’t expected to leave Beijing until late Wednesday afternoon.

> Many American officials and businesses complain that China has long wiggled out of commitments — accusations that China denies. And the more hawkish wing of the administration contends that Beijing’s assurances have been so vague that it is hard to discern any meaningful progress, a position some analysts support.
>
> Beijing’s effort so far adds up “to a modest adjustment of Chinese foreign economic policy,” said Scott Kennedy, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, “but nowhere close to the great leap in liberalization that the U.S. and others are seeking.”

> Mr Trump is playing offence, using brinkmanship to try to upend years of Chinese economic policy including forced technology transfer and exports that compete with American companies. Mr Xi is defending a status quo that has brought China extraordinary economic growth and enriched many US businesses, too.
>
> Both presidents are increasingly vulnerable at home. Mr Trump is battling a resurgent Democratic party and Mr Xi is struggling with slowing economic growth. Both are facing volatile markets. Analysts say these forces have brought the two sides closer to doing a deal but the gap remains wide.

## A complicated new variable

[With Kim’s Visit, China Shows U.S. It Has Leverage on Trade](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/business/china-north-korea-kim-trade.html) <br> *by Keith Bradsher & Choe Sang-Hun, from nytimes.com, 20190108*

> Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, arrived by train in Beijing on Tuesday to meet with Mr. Xi during the second day of talks nearby between midlevel trade negotiators from China and the United States. Though the government said the events were unconnected, Mr. Kim’s surprise visit was an unmistakable reminder that China could complicate the Trump administration’s pursuit of other goals — including ridding the North of nuclear weapons — if the two powers fail to strike a deal on trade.

> The timing of the Xi-Kim meeting—as U.S. and Chinese negotiators held their latest round of trade talks in Beijing—represents a “coincidence of interest” between North Korea and China, said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. Back in 2017, when Pyongyang was testing long-range nuclear missiles, the U.S. and its allies looked to Beijing to help broker a solution.
>
> Now, Beijing could see North Korea as leverage in its trade dispute with the U.S., while Pyongyang needs China’s assistance securing a second summit with Mr. Trump.
>
> “It’s in Beijing’s interest to remind the U.S. they can be very helpful on North Korea,” Mr. Tsang said. “It’s a message from both Beijing and Pyongyang to Washington.”
