> An attempt by Hong Kong’s leader to push a Beijing-backed extradition bill galvanized unprecedented resistance to tighter mainland control, presenting Chinese President Xi Jinping with the most high-profile challenge yet to his authority.
>
> On Sunday, [a massive crowd of protesters](https://www.wsj.com/articles/protesters-crowd-hong-kongs-streets-once-more-11560668928) flooded central Hong Kong, capping a week of [demonstrations and at times violent confrontations](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-protest-debate-postponed-on-extradition-bill-as-crowds-swell-in-opposition-11560309637) between protesters and police. Organizers estimated the crowd at nearly two million people and said it was the biggest rally Hong Kong has seen since China reclaimed sovereignty of the city from Britain in 1997, though police put the figures substantially lower.

> Upheaval in Hong Kong—long a key to China’s trade and business with the West—could seriously set back its long-term goal of fully incorporating the city without setting off civil unrest, and potentially risk inspiring similar actions in mainland China. President Xi’s goal of reintegrating Taiwan into the mainland has also suffered a setback.

> China’s leader, Xi Jinping, was in Tajikistan on Saturday, celebrating his 66th birthday with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, when the political crisis in Hong Kong took a dramatic turn with an unexpected retreat in the face of mass protests.
>
> Mr. Xi’s trip fortuitously gave him some distance from the events in Hong Kong, where the [leadership on Saturday suspended](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/world/asia/china-hong-kong-politics.html?module=inline) its push for legislation to allow extraditions to mainland China. But the measure had been backed by Beijing, and there was no mistaking that the reversal was a stinging setback for him.

> The move, the [biggest concession to public pressure](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/world/asia/china-hong-kong-politics.html?module=inline) during Mr. Xi’s nearly seven years as China’s paramount leader, suggests that there are still limits to his power, especially involving events outside the mainland, even as he has governed with an increasingly authoritarian grip.

> Hong Kong’s unique position—a haven of the rule of law and free debate on the doorstep of a phenomenally lucrative market that enjoys neither—was being eroded well before this month’s drama. Since the 2014 Occupy protests to demand universal suffrage, which took over a swath of the city center for more than two months, the government has jailed pro-democracy activists, prevented candidates with similar views from running for office, and banned political parties from advocating independence. Last year officials took the unheard-of step of refusing to renew a visa for a Western journalist, Victor Mallet of the *Financial Times*, who’d presided over an appearance by a pro-independence activist at the famed Foreign Correspondents’ Club. And in the absence of an extradition arrangement, at least two people have been apparently abducted by Chinese agents from Hong Kong soil—both of them dual citizens of China and Western countries.

> With the manufacturing that catalyzed its post-war boom largely decamped to cheaper locations on the mainland or in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong has struggled to spark new industries. It’s largely failed to become a technology hub: It isn’t easy operating a bootstrapped startup in a city where a smallish apartment can rent for over $5,000 a month. Nor have U.S. giants such as Netflix Inc., Facebook, or Google set up a major local presence. None of them can operate freely in China’s sealed-off digital market, making Hong Kong’s status as a gateway—already diminished, since many companies that do have significant Chinese business prefer to put local headquarters in Shanghai or Beijing—irrelevant.

> Put simply, Hong Kong is acting as a guardian of China’s memory and of the hope that a more liberal China could one day replace the current one-party state. The “[one country, two systems](https://www.ft.com/content/323dec9c-8d0c-11e9-b8cb-26a9caa9d67b)” arrangement put in place when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 has allowed the territory to continue to preserve vital freedoms, such as an independent judiciary and a free press.
>
> Hong Kong is not a full democracy. Its chief executive is elected by a tiny group from a Beijing-approved list. But, nonetheless, since 1997 the territory has provided room for ideas, people and organisations banned from mainland China. I know of well-connected Beijing families who have taken their children to Hong Kong for the June 4 commemoration — just to ensure that the memory of Tiananmen is passed down through the generations.
>
> Hong Kong’s peculiar role within China makes the current struggle over its legal system of global significance. If Hong Kong’s freedoms can be protected, that will also help to preserve breathing room for liberal ideas within the Chinese state. That matters not just to the Chinese people, but to a wider world that will increasingly be shaped by the power of a rising China.
