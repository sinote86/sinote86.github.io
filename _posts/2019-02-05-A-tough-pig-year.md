> As the Sinocised world ushered in the lunar new year on Tuesday, China’s leaders must have been praying for some of that luck as they struggle with a slowing economy, burgeoning trade war with the US and a series of symbolic, and politically dangerous, anniversaries.
>
> It is an open secret in China that many members of the officially atheist Communist party are actually devout believers in Buddhism, Daoism or ancient folk traditions the party derides as “superstition”. At this time of year, temples across the country, many of which were closed or destroyed in the 1960s during Mao Zedong’s cultural revolution, are teeming with party bigwigs praying for luck or consulting fortune-tellers about the year ahead.

> Given the importance of numbers and anniversaries in Chinese cosmology, and political life, this year of the pig is particularly portentous.

> Peppa, the cartoon piglet for preschoolers that was created in Britain and whose TV show airs around the world, once faced an uncertain future in China. Now she is inspiring a bout of giddiness.

> The feel-good fervor is a turnaround for Peppa after the cartoon character was branded a subversive element last year. Some questioned whether her lifestyle was too extravagant, or her behavior too wild.

## China-US

[The Unpredictable Rise of China](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/how-americans-misunderstand-chinas-ambitions/581869/) <br> *by Daniel Blumenthal, from theatlantic.com, 20190203*

> China’s new economic model of debt-financed overinvestment was worsened by the financial crisis of 2008. At the time, most U.S. observers believed that China was poised to overtake the U.S. But these policy makers missed how panicked China was during this crisis: Its global export markets dried up, so it turned to domestic credit to prime the pump. China accumulated even more debt through a massive stimulus package. The experience seems to have convinced China’s leaders that time was no longer on their side, and that they had to make some quick gains. From the financial crisis onward, China’s assertiveness reflected not a confidence in its destiny, but rather a basic insecurity. China’s muscular assertion of territorial claims grew from its economic troubles, political fractiousness, and the implementation of the wide-ranging stability maintenance regime.

> Xi inherited not only a weakening economy, but also a fractured political elite. As the succession from Hu Jintao was unfolding in 2012, the CCP faced one of its biggest political crises. The charismatic leader of Chongqing province, Bo Xilai, made an independent bid for CCP leadership. The party moved fast to remove him and punish his wife for corruption and murder. In the process, it exposed to public view the extraordinary levels of corruption within the CCP’s top ranks.

> The United States indictments against Huawei look set to significantly worsen already tense relations between China and the U.S. As America pressures allies to drop Huawei and other Chinese firms, U.S. and European officials point to China’s own laws as evidence that even private firms are potential arms of the Chinese state, and the political atmosphere grows ever colder in Beijing, the vision of a world brought together through technology feels ever more distant.

[China’s Online Censorship Stifles Trade, Too](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/opinion/china-censorship-internet.html) <br> *by Tim Wu, from nytimes.com, 20190204*

> China has long defended its censorship as a political matter, a legitimate attempt to protect citizens from what the government regards as “harmful information,” including material that “spreads unhealthy lifestyles and pop culture.” But you don’t need to be a trade theorist to realize that the censorship is also an extremely effective barrier to international trade. The global internet economy is worth at least $8 trillion and growing, yet the Trump administration has focused chiefly on manufacturing, technology transfers and agriculture, and does not seem to have pressed for concessions on this issue.
>
> Sheltered from American, Japanese and European competition, Chinese internet businesses have grown enormously over the past decade. Nine of the world’s 20 largest internet firms, by market value, are now Chinese. Some of this growth reflects the skill and innovation of Chinese engineers, a vibrant start-up culture and the success of Chinese business in catering to local tastes. But it’s hard to believe that this has been unaided by censorship.

## Slowdown

> China’s slowing economy and trade tensions with the US have hurt low-wage workers in the export industry. But the effects are now extending to graduates from top universities, said analysts. The problem is acute for those seeking employment with finance and tech companies, which have been cutting workers.
>
> Another masters student at a top Beijing university said: “I feel the job market is increasingly narrow for students like me, given that a historical number of us are graduating. I also think employers have decreased or stopped hiring.” She cited a state-owned enterprise that last year recruited 10 students but this year was taking one.

> China’s hard-charging technology sector, which has produced some of the world’s hottest public companies and unicorn startups, is experiencing something different: a slowdown.
>
> While not yet a meltdown, especially for big established companies, for many startups and smaller firms in a sector that barely existed a decade ago, this is the worst they have seen it. Investors, entrepreneurs and the media are calling it the Chinese internet’s “freezing winter.”
