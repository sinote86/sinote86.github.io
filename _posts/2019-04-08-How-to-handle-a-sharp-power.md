[With Pressure and Persuasion, China Deflects Criticism of Its Camps for Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/asia/china-muslims-camps.html) <br> *by Jane Perlez, from nytimes.com, 20190408*

> China has been fighting criticism that it has detained as many as one million members of Muslim ethnic minorities in indoctrination camps in its western Xinjiang region...
>
> Its vast system of detention without trial has drawn condemnation from the State Department and Congress, but no sanctions, and only scattered criticism in Europe and at the United Nations. That is still more of a response than in the Muslim world, where nations — including Pakistan, Indonesia and other recipients of big Chinese loans — have overlooked China’s abuses against ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others.
>
> And as Muslim countries fall in line, the West is under less pressure to take action.
>
> The major deterrent to antagonizing Beijing is its blunt economic power.

[Global Silence on China’s Gulag](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/xi-china-gulag-uighur-muslims-xinjiang-by-brahma-chellaney-2019-04) <br> *by Brahma Chellaney, from project-syndicate.org, 20190408*

> In its reliance on mass detention, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has followed the Soviet Union’s example. But China’s concentration camps and detention centers are far larger and more technologically advanced than their Soviet precursors, and their purpose is to indoctrinate not just political dissidents, but an entire community of faith.
>
> Although independent researchers and human-rights groups have raised awareness of practices such as force-feeding Muslims alcohol and pork, the Chinese authorities have been able to continue their assault on Islam with impunity. Even as China’s security agencies pursue Uighurs and other Muslims as far afield as Turkey, Chinese leaders and companies involved in the persecution have not faced international sanctions or incurred any other costs.

> The irony is that while China justifies its “[reeducation hospitals](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/02/07/reeducating-xinjiangs-muslims/)” as necessary to cleanse Muslim minds at home of extremist thoughts, it is effectively [supporting](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-enabling-terror-leaders-to-operate-freely-by-shashi-tharoor-2019-03) Islamist terrorism abroad...
>
> An added irony is that while China still harps on its “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign imperial powers, it has for decades presided over the mass humiliation of minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet. Ominously, by systematically degrading Muslim populations, it could be inspiring white supremacists and other Islamaphobes around the world...

[How Should Europe Handle Relations with China?](http://www.chinafile.com/conversation/how-should-europe-handle-relations-china) <br> *by A ChinaFile Conversation, from chinafile.com, 20190408*

> When Xi Jinping visited Europe in late March, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker [portrayed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/26/emmanuel-macron-meets-chinese-leader-in-attempt-to-strengthen-ties) the future of EU-China relations in mixed terms: “We are strategic partners, and yes, rivals,” he said, “but competition among us is a good thing.” Indeed, EU member states have been at odds about China for a while, and deteriorating U.S.-China relations are complicating matters. The U.S. is pressuring its European allies to limit the market presence of the Chinese technology giant Huawei, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently visiting Poland, Hungary and Slovakia to raise the alarm. Italy, which in late March became the first G7 member to join China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), may work with the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Meanwhile, Germany and the UK are forging their own formulas for restrictions and partnerships.

> On April 9, China’s Premier Li Keqiang will visit Brussels for the EU-China Summit —as European nations debate where to draw the line on investment, national security, and emerging technologies. How should Europe, and various European nations, handle their relationship with China? And is Europe breaking into two spheres of influence—one American and one Chinese?  —*The Editors*

[Is it a threat to US security that China owns Grindr, a gay dating app?](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/is-it-a-threat-to-us-security-that-china-owns-grindr-a-gay-dating-app/) <br> *by Sarah Bauerle Danzman, from brookings.edu, 20190408*

> The Grindr decision shows how the [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/foreign-investment-and-us-national-security) (CFIUS) is adopting a more expansive view of national security. But the notion that a dating app could threaten national security is not as ludicrous as it seems. Like other social networking companies, Grindr keeps a lot of social data on its customers, including U.S. officials and government contractors who could be blackmailed or compromised. Moreover, since Grindr uses geolocation, it can track its users’ movements. Although it is impossible to know precisely why CFIUS intervened in this case—the agency is secretive and never discloses the specific justifications for its decisions—[reporting suggests](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/grindr-china-national-security.html) these data privacy issues were an important factor...
>
> Governments’ concerns about foreign ownership are expanding from a narrow focus on military and intelligence to include issues such as data privacy, critical infrastructure, dual-use technology and strategically important industries. Western governments have already [been arguing for several years over whether they should welcome or shun Chinese foreign direct investment](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/08/12/will-the-west-welcome-or-shun-chinese-fdi/), without reaching clear conclusions. CFIUS was supposed to stop investment screening from being politicized, but now the politics seem here to stay.

[Why the Chinese government has blocked the nation’s most popular soap operas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/04/08/why-chinese-government-has-blocked-nations-most-popular-soap-operas/) <br> *by Fei-Hsien Wang, from washingtonpost.com, 20190408*

> Why did the soap operas trigger such a dramatic response? Because in China, a television drama about Qianlong is never just a television drama about Qianlong. In a culture with a long tradition of using history to debate the present, historical soap operas are often read as commentaries on the current regime. Indeed, the soaring popularity of period dramas set in the Qing dynasty in recent years indicates Chinese audiences share a keen interest in using China’s glorious past as a guide for China’s future. But for Chinese viewers and their government, “Making China Great Again” through this version of Qianlong could create real political problems.
>
> That’s because Qianlong is both a reminder of Chinese primacy in the world and an embodiment of the imperial past that the modern Chinese state was created to overcome. The problem? Those narratives contradict each other, revealing a hard-to-reconcile tension within China’s vision of again becoming a “great power.”
