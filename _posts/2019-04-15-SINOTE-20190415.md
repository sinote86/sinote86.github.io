[One Month, 500,000 Face Scans: How China Is Using A.I. to Profile a Minority](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html) <br> *by Paul Mozur, from nytimes.com, 20190414*

> The Chinese government has drawn wide [international condemnation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/asia/china-muslims-camps.html) for its harsh crackdown on ethnic Muslims in its western region, including holding as many as a million of them in detention camps.

> Now, documents and interviews show that the authorities are also using a vast, secret system of advanced facial recognition technology to track and control the Uighurs, a [largely Muslim minority](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html). It is the first known example of a government intentionally using artificial intelligence for racial profiling, experts said.
>
> The facial recognition technology, which is integrated into China’s rapidly expanding networks of surveillance cameras, looks exclusively for Uighurs based on their appearance and keeps records of their comings and goings for search and review. The practice makes China a pioneer in applying next-generation technology to watch its people, potentially ushering in a new era of automated racism.

[Why Donald Trump is great news for Xi Jinping](https://www.ft.com/content/caaf71d8-5f5a-11e9-b285-3acd5d43599e) <br> *by Gideon Rachman, from ft.com, 20190415*

> But calling off the trade war will not be the only gift from Mr Trump to Chinese president Xi Jinping. For Mr Trump has already disarmed America in an even more important battle — the battle of ideas.
>
> That matters because America’s most potent weapon in its emerging contest for supremacy with China is not its economy, nor its aircraft carriers, but its ideas. The notion that abstract principles like “freedom” and “democracy” are powerful American assets is sometimes dismissed as liberal wishful-thinking. But Chinese actions suggest otherwise. The government of Mr Xi does its utmost to suppress the circulation of liberal and western ideas, censoring the internet and cracking down on dissidents, students and human rights lawyers.

[The Taiwanese Populist Advancing China’s Interests](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/taiwanese-populist-han-kuo-yu-china/587146/) <br> *by Chris Horton, from theatlantic.com, 20190415*

> The scene is, on the surface, a familiar one. A populist candidate with unexpected momentum captures nonstop media attention and sees a surge of support online, much of it connected to accounts originating from a rival country. Could he become president?
>
> The candidate is not, however, Donald Trump, and the country where the election is taking place is not the United States, or anywhere nearby. Yet the outcome is of crucial importance to Washington and its foreign policy.
>
> Welcome to Taiwan, where Han Kuo-yu, a once–washed-up former legislator, shocked this island of 23 million last year by beating out the early favorite to become the mayor of Kaohsiung—an office that, in American terms, has the same political currency as that of the governor of Texas or Florida. And with a presidential election coming up in January, a growing chorus of voices on the China-friendly side of Taiwan’s political spectrum is calling for this Trumpian figure to enter the fray. Han has not officially said that he will run, but he has already enchanted much of the Taiwanese electorate, and has a good chance of becoming Taiwan’s next president.

[Gene-Edited Babies: What a Chinese Scientist Told an American Mentor](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/health/gene-editing-babies.html) <br>*by Pam Belluck, from nytimes.com, 20190414*

> “Success!” read the subject line of the email. The text, in imperfect English, began: “Good News! The women is pregnant, the genome editing success!”
>
> The sender was He Jiankui, an ambitious, young Chinese scientist. The recipient was his former academic adviser, Stephen Quake, a star Stanford bioengineer and inventor.
>
> “Wow, that’s quite an achievement!” Dr. Quake wrote back. “Hopefully she will carry to term...”
>
> Months later, the world learned [the outcome of that pregnancy:](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html) twins born from genetically engineered embryos, the first gene-altered babies. Reaction was fierce. Many scientists and ethicists [condemned the experiment as unethical and unsafe](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/health/crispr-gene-editing-embryos.html), fearing that it could inspire rogue or frivolous attempts to create permanent genetic changes using unproven and unregulated methods.

[China’s Anime and Cosplay Obsession](https://chinachannel.org/2019/04/12/2d/) <br> *by Tanner Greer, from chinachannel.org, 20190412*

> “Most people have no idea I do this,” said Wu Na, beaming, as costumed conference-goers stopped to take her picture. The 14-year-old was wearing a thin cotton cloak over a knee-length tunic. As I talked to her, a boy walked into the convention hall sporting spiked hair, a neon-purple trench coat, and a bare chest. Like the hundreds of other cosplaying teenagers in the convention hall, he was not going to allow Beijing’s frigid January temperatures to cramp his style. “I have trouble connecting with most other people at school,” Wu reflected. “But in the two-dimensional world there is a sense of community I can’t find anywhere else. My second-dimension friends mean so much more to me than my third-dimension friends do.”
>
> Wu is just one of the hundreds of millions wrapped up in what young Chinese call the “second dimension” (二次元). The closest English parallel is the ACG, or animation-comic-gaming sector, the market’s favorite acronym for a certain class of Japanese pop culture exports: anime, manga, and the merchandise inspired by them. The two-dimensional world Chinese teenagers such as Wu Na live in includes all of these elements, but their self-styled “second dimension” extends further – and is not limited to Japanese ACG, also factoring in anime-styled cartoons drawn in Korea, China and the United States.

> ...
>
> What is it that draws these overwhelmingly urban, educated, middle-class Chinese youth to the second dimension? Ask this question to them, and you will hear the same word again and again: *meihao* (美好) – a compound of the Chinese words for beautiful and good, used to describe not just physical beauty, but a sense of idyll, wonder or perfection.
