> A Chinese spacecraft has made the first landing on the far side of the moon, touching down in the South Pole-Aitken basin. The mission aims to take detailed measurements of the moon’s terrain and mineral composition.

> China gained on the U.S. in the new space race by making the first-ever landing on the far side of the moon. What's driving China’s ambitions and should the U.S. be nervous? The WSJ explains.

> Compared with previous missions, however, the reaction to Thursday’s milestones seemed strikingly restrained, both in the country’s state-run news outlets and on social media. On China’s most-watched TV news program early Thursday evening, the landing — declared a success by officials at mission control — was not even one of the four top stories.
>
> The doodle of China’s biggest search engine, Baidu, paid subtle homage to the lander and its rover, but the news was relegated to the fifth item on CCTV’s 7 p.m. news program. It followed three reports on the doings of the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, and an item on a new government zone being developed outside Beijing. In interviews, several people said they had paid little attention to the moon landing.
>
> The muted reaction was a sign that the novelty of the country’s space missions has faded. But the coverage also appeared to reflect political and economic anxieties at a time when Mr. Xi’s government is trying to negotiate a truce in the trade war with the United States and respond to worrisome cracks in the economy.

> “This is more than just a landing,” said Alan Duffy, a lead scientist with the Royal Institution of Australia who focuses on space exploration. “Today’s announcement was a clear statement about the level of maturity that China’s technology has now reached. Beijing’s longer-term goal to match U.S. capabilities could now become reality within two decades, and on the moon within perhaps only one decade.”
>
> From a scientific standpoint, Thursday’s announcement surprised some who had expected the endeavor to fail. Landing a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, which never faces Earth, hasn’t been done before because its location makes direct radio signal communication impossible. But Chinese researchers were able to overcome this challenge by launching a relay satellite to communicate with the Chang’e 4 spacecraft and its rover.

> Space exploration has always been as much a quest for geopolitical gain as it has for scientific discovery. The Americans and the Russians carried out launch after launch in the middle of the century not, first and foremost, for the sake of science, but in the name of national identity. China’s civilian and military space programs—and their motivations—are inextricably linked. Some analysts say it can be easy to overstate the influence of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army on space activities, and point out that the scientists and engineers on the civilian side are like scientists and engineers at NASA. But there is no solid delineation between the two. China’s ambitions in space are as strategic as the Vostok and Apollo programs of the 1960s.

> “When you are the first country to land a probe on the far side of the moon, that says something about your science and technology, that says something about your industry,” says Dean Cheng, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., and one of the few Chinese-speaking analysts in the U.S. that focus on China’s space program. “It says something about what you can achieve that in turn is going to affect how countries view China when it comes to terrestrial issues, whether it’s border disputes, whether it’s building islands in the South China Sea, whether it’s Taiwan’s future.”

## Apple and Chinese consumers

[Apple warning bell triggers fears for global economy](https://www.ft.com/content/2abeab48-0f79-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745) <br> *by Robin Wigglesworth, Tim Bradshaw & Richard Waters, from ft.com, 20190103*

> Apple’s unexpected warning on weak Chinese sales  has stoked fears over the health of the global economy, rattling financial markets and leading traders to bet that the Federal Reserve is more likely to cut interest rates  than raise them in 2019.

> ...
>
> Few economists expect the US economy to enter a recession this year, but concerns over broader implications of the Chinese slowdown are growing, given how big a role the Asian giant has played in the post-crisis global economic recovery.
>
> Robin Li, chief executive of Baidu, the Chinese search engine, also warned his employees on Wednesday that “winter is coming” as the Chinese economy weakens. In a new year letter to staff, he said that shifts in the economy were “as cold and real as winter to every company”. Baidu shares dropped 4.7 per cent in New York trading.

> Apple’s cut in its sales forecast was blamed almost entirely on the economic slowdown in China, but the real picture is probably far more complex, with high prices, cultural differences, fierce competition and consumers keeping their phones for longer all causing problems.

> China’s current economic slowdown differs from previous downturns because this time Chinese consumers are taking a hit. A less-certain economic outlook, the trade fight with the U.S., rising living costs and expectations of slower income growth are weighing on household spending. Meanwhile, slowing sales, rising costs and trade-related uncertainties are squeezing businesses’ profit margins, from retailers to manufacturers.

> For years, no matter what was happening elsewhere, global companies bet billions upon billions of dollars that China’s consumers would keep spending money.
>
> Now, just when the world economy could use their financial firepower, they are holding back, worried about the country’s slowing growth, a trade war with the United States and rising amounts of personal debt.

> ...
>
> A significant pullback could have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China’s continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed Chinese consumers as a steady source of profits.

> ...

> The rise of the Chinese consumer is not over yet, and Apple’s disappointing numbers stem in part from the company’s own decisions. But the weakness at Apple followed reams of other data — declining car sales, faltering retail sales, a slumping property market, a tougher job market — that signal Chinese consumers may be losing their once unshakable confidence.
