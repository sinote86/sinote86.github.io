## Hong Kong

[Hong Kong’s struggle is ours too. It’s a wake-up call to defend all basic human rights](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/19/hong-kong-activists-human-rights) <br> *by Natalie Nougayrède, from theguardian.com, 20190619*

> We’re stunned by the images of Hong Kong not just because of the scale of these events or their historical dimension, but also because they somehow shake us out of a lethargy. Had we not become blase or cynical or fatalistic about the chances of defending human rights? Had we not started flirting with the notion that some principles might work fine for our western world but can hardly be considered as imperatives for others? Would that be because of our own imperfect record, our past empires, our “wars of choice”, our western desolation in times of Donald Trump, Brexit, the far-right in Europe, arms sales to Saudi, you name it? Or might it be because some of the nihilism on social media has blunted us? Hong Kong is a brilliant, festive wake-up call, but with an attached worry: can those young people prevail?

> Hong Kong rose up against an extradition law that threatens to place any citizen there at the mercy of China’s autocratic system. What the demonstrators have marched for is driven by homegrown aspirations, not some foreign-concocted challenge to the Chinese regime. What motivates Hong Kong’s population relates to basic human dignity – something that’s borderless and found in each individual, not a product of western encroachment.

> Christians have been a visible part of the protests this month — among the largest in Hong Kong’s history — providing food and shelter at demonstrations and condemning [efforts by the police to break them up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-bill.html?module=inline). Many protesters, even those who are not religious, have embraced the teachings and messages of Christianity to denounce a proposed law to allow extraditions to mainland China.

> Protesters have spoken of “loving thy neighbor” and winning a battle of “good versus evil.” Youth groups have held prayer circles to call for peace and redemption for the police. A hymn called “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord” has become an unofficial anthem of the demonstrations, echoing from bridges and makeshift shelters.

[Hong Kong in Protest](http://www.chinafile.com/conversation/hong-kong-protest) <br> *by A ChinaFile Conversation, from chinafile.com, 20190619*

> On June 16, an [estimated 2 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-hong-kong-protests-extradition-to-china/) people took to the streets to protest the Hong Kong government’s handling of a proposed extradition bill. This followed two massive demonstrations against the bill earlier in the month, including one where police [used](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html)pepper spray and tear gas against protesters. The controversial bill would allow Hong Kong to [extradite](https://www.ft.com/content/2063019c-7619-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) to the mainland those accused of crimes under the People’s Republic of China’s Communist Party-led legal system. While Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has [suspended](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/19/733947873/hong-kong-leaders-apologize-for-extradition-bill-as-territory-braces-for-more-pr) the bill, she has refused to withdraw it.

[Fears of capital flight as Beijing tightens grip on Hong Kong](https://www.ft.com/content/79dbc0b6-91bb-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2) <br> *by Don Weinland, Henny Sender & Siddarth Shrikanth, from ft.com, 20190619*

> Distrust of the government has for years led mainland Chinese business elites to move their wealth out of the reach of Beijing. For the richest of the rich, Hong Kong used to be seen as a haven but in recent years they have become increasingly wary as China has tightened its grip on the territory.
>
> These fears are shared by a range of businesses operating in the territory, a financial, media and professional services hub, particularly after the introduction of the extradition bill earlier this year. Ms Lam suspended debate on the bill after an estimated 2m Hong Kong residents [took to the streets](https://www.ft.com/content/d5c4dc36-9009-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271) on Sunday. But the attempt to push through a law that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China has given new impetus to the exodus of capital and businesses from the city.
